Idealism is corrupted and proved almost as irrational as psychosis.", "Can you eleborate on that? Help me understand because I'm not entirely sure why things happened the way they did in the movie.", "It's actually pretty simple, Brad Pitt proves Kevin Spacey right, but Morgan Freeman rededicates himself to justice, so maybe he was wrong too. I suppose the point is that anyone can succumb to dark impulses, not just someone who is insane.", "Ok what is seemed like Kevin Spacey's character was almost punishing Brad Pitt for a Sin that he was going to commit in the future, which I think sort of plays against his \"holy\" reasoning for the murders he committed.", "You're thinking way too much into the script. Keep it simple, The only reason this is sticking out in your mind is because there isn't a solution.", "Why didn't Brad Pitt just kill himself at the end?", "Brad Pitt faces a choice between a vengeance that is literally nothing but wrath, or a moral high ground that still feels like failure.
