{"conversations": [["The 80s was definitely the best year for horror. They gave us iconic slasher villains like Freddie Krueger and Jason Voorhees!", "I'd have to disagree. I'm more partial to the Alfred Hitchcock era, he was a true master of suspense.", "I've never really heard too much about Hitchcock, but I've seen The Birds. Black and white movies aren't my thing though.", "I highly recommend you check more of his movies out! Without Hitchcock, the horror genre would never be the same.", "What kind of films would you suggest to me? Obviously I've seen The Birds already!", "There are so many out there! A few of my personal recommendations include Psycho, Dial M for Murder, and The Man Who Knew Too Much.", "Sounds good! Are there color versions of any of these films? Black and white is quite dull on the eyes.", "Some of the best movies ever made have been in black and white, but I'm sure there are some remastered colored versions out there, if that floats your boat.", "I see what you're getting out, I'll check some of those movies out. Any newer horror movies you looking forward too?", "None really, I feel that newer horror movies are too clich\u00e9 and rely too heavily on overused jump scares."], ["What did you think of The Babadook?", "Loved it now that I finally got a chance to watch it. Far too often nidern day horror is disappointing.", "See I knew you would like it, it reminds me of a good classic horror film.", "I can certainly see the comparison, it was refreshing to not rely on so many jump scares.", "Yeah for me it's all about atmosphere and this film had it in spades.", "Agreed it also makes me wonder what Jennifer Kent is going to direct next.", "Whatever it is I eagerly anticipate it, think she's got quite the future ahead of her.", "No doubt about it, Noah Wiseman also played the bratty little kid to perfection.", "He did, but not sure I would necessarily say he was bratty, well okay he was, but more a product of his environment.", "Yeah that kid had things pretty rough."], ["Have you ever seen The Blair Witch Project?", "I did. I saw it when it first came out in theaters actually.", "How did you like it? Was it hard to watch?", "It really was. I literally couldn't stomach the shaky cam.", "That's what made me hate it at first, but I started appreciating it upon subsequent viewing.", "That's how it was with me. You see how terrifying it is after watching it a few times.", "That's true. That's why I don't go into the woods to this day.", "I believe that movie started the whole \"found footage\" movie fascination.", "You're right. That air of mystery and possibility of it being true really draws people.", "I didn't know it wasn't real until the characters came out at the MTV movie awards!"], ["Do you like horror movies", "Sometimes", "Have you seen the blair witch project?", "No it looks kind of dumb to me", "It was a little dumb", "And i dont like movies with the camera like that", "Yea i understand that, it hurts my head", "I dont know why movie companies think its a good idea", "I dont either", "Its an awful idea"], ["Have you seen the movie They're Watching?", "I think so, is that the movie with Brigid Brannagh?", "Yes, I really enjoyed it. I thought they did a good job creating a creepy element with the town and townspeople.", "Agreed, the scene with all of the townspeople gathered outside of Becky's house was very creepy.", "It was! I thought the ending was interesting too.", "Agreed, you pretty much expected Becky to be the witch though.", "True, but they did it in a unique enough way that you don't mind how predictable it was. The effects were well done too.", "They sure were! The magic at the end was really good, and the parts where they found Kate and Vladimir were very well done.", "They were, though those scenes were a bit gory for my taste.", "That's understandable, but they certainly made an impact!"], ["Paranormal Activity was pretty good", "It was and made you think about if it could be real.", "How did you like how the storyline unfolded?", "I though it was a bit dsijointed.", "Id say it was more along the lines of a horror film.", "Yeah but where do you think the film could have gone", "In a direction where you would see something", "The aura of not knowing was the entire plot.", "Yeah it was a strange way to go about it", "But audiences were freaked out I bet."], ["Name a good horror movie for me to watch.", "Warlock.", "What is that one?", "It's an amazing movie from 1989.", "Is there another one?", "Yeah, there is a part 2, which I like better.", "I am a fan of horror movies.

But thanks for ruining it."], ["Hey are you going to watch the Halloween horror movie marathon this weekend?", "I might, how recent are the movies they are showing?", "Movies from the 80's till this past year.", "Awesome I'm coming over to your place then this weekend.", "I really hope they show Freddy vs Jason that movie was so badass!", "Omg I know.That movie was a dream come true.", "Even though it got a lot of bad reviews I absolutely loved the battle between Freddy and Jason.", "Yes that was some of the best parts!", "I just wish they would make a sequel to that movie already.", "They totally should since it was foreshadowing that Freddy was still alive."], ["So, what horror films do you want to see?", "Well, gosh there's several that have been out for awhile i want to watch but haven't gotten around to. For examples, Train to Busan/", "I don't think I've heard of that one.", "Yeah, it's from South Korea.  It's about this guy and his young daughter who get onboard a bullet and it starts getting taken over by zombies.  i heard it's got a lot of action and is real suspenseful.", "Whoa, that sounds pretty cool.", "Yeah, another one I want to see is The Girl With All the Gift.", "I'm sensing a theme here...", "Haha.. yeah, they both have to do with zombies... although I don't think they're called that in The Girl.", "Yeah, I've heard people praising that film as really good.", "I may have to read the book it's based on first"], ["I need a good horror movie to watch; can you recommend anything new?", "Have you seen Get Out yet?", "No, but I heard about it. Tell me more.", "It is Jordan Peele's first movie as director and he has a good knack for creating suspense and creepy situations.", "Isn't he that guy from SNL?", "Yeah, and there is a comic relief character, but sometimes you need the relief because the movie is so intense.", "So is it like a horror-comedy?", "It is mostly horror, and commentary on how supposedly non-racist liberal whites exploit black Americans.", "Whoa that sounds heavy. Is it preachy, though?", "Nope, but the social commentary is really unsettling."], ["Man check out this costume.  It's looks just like Freddy Kruger.", "Cool.  You going to be Freddy this year?", "No, I was thinking about being the Swamp Monster and having my Mom help me make the costume.", "I'm going to buy mine.  I was thinking about going as Pinhead.

How bout yours?", "I don't know.  The bloodier the better.", "Right.  Like chainsaw massacre."], ["I saw Sixth Sense again not too long ago.", "That's a classic. That's when M.Night Shyamalan was doing it right.", "Yes, he's just now beginning to turn around with The Visit and Split.", "Yeah but in the Sixth Sense, he really got the atmosphere right.", "I agree. No one saw that ending coming.", "Neither did I. Haley Joel Osment did such a great job in that role.", "He really did. Bruce Willis too, but Osment stole the show.", "That part with Donnie Wahlberg at the beginning was one of the scariest parts.", "Yes that and the part with the little girl who kept appearing to the little boy.", "I don't know if I could handle a gift, or curse, like being able to see dead people. It would drive me nuts."], ["What do you think of The Purge movies?", "They're a bit ridiculous but they seem like they could happen in America.", "How could that happen?", "If the NRA took over, it would probably happen.", "Would you consider it horror?", "Yeah, definitely. It's basically home invasion, but the whole country.", "I only saw the first one. Did you see the others?", "Yup.", "How were they?", "The second was awful, but the third redeems itself a bit."], ["Have you ever seen Waxworks?", "The movie with Paris Hilton?", "No, there was an older one.", "Oh, really?

They are remaking all the classics.", "Instead of remakes of perfectly good movies they could do more sequels, or just leave them alone!", "I agree with that!"], ["What is a good horror movie you've watched recently?", "I watched The Thing again the other night.", "You watch that a lot, you must really like that movie.", "Yes, it's one of my favorite horror movies.

He is a talented director.", "Yeah, he has a great mind for horror.", "Doesn't it take place in Antarctica?", "Yes, that location is really unique for a horror movie. It also helps create a tremendous feeling of isolation and claustrophobia which really adds to the level of tension and fear in the movie. That's a big reason why I love it."], ["I've been watching a lot of horror movies lately", "Oh yea, any good ones?", "I really like Saw", "It is a classic, especially the 1st movie", "It definetly had elements of mystery and some really horrific scenes", "Being trapped in a room with a physcho like that would make me crazy.", "Yea, I think thats the point", "Saw 2 was pretty good too.", "Yea, it was not a bad sequel", "I liked that it kept the same elements and didnt go too crazy with the storyline."], ["How much did you like The Ring?", "I thought it was an OK movie.", "Why would you say that?", "I just think the premise was boring.", "In what manner?", "Watching a video tape?", "Yeah it was just new.", "But they should have something different that was believable.", "Oh ok yeah I get where youre coming from", "But the villain so to speak was pretty cool in that she was scary."], ["Are thier any good thiller moviers out now", "Over the weekend i watch kissing by sharon sala", "Yeah man she's good", "It had on the edge of my seat", "Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food", "It wasn't funny at all just creepy", "It was really scary", "And creepily", "On Saturday i will see something funny", "But this movie was not bad"], ["I want to watch a good horror movie.

The monster is very scary.", "Can you recommend another movie like that one?", "Sure, try part 2 and 3.", "I had no idea there was more than one.", "There is. You should also check out Dead Alive, since that one is an oddball horror flick too.", "I will. Who directed Dead Alive?", "Peter Jackson"], ["The Shining was on last night.  Man, that movie is scary.", "I know.  All work and no play makes Johnny a frightening character.", "Every time it comes on, I have to watch, yet I always regret it.  I have trouble sleeping after I do.", "Yeah, I know what you mean.  It really messes with your mind.", "It's cool, though, how it's become part of popular culture now.  You see references to it in a lot of other shows.", "Really, like what?", "Well, there's one South Park that totally parallels it.  One of the character buys a Blockbuster, so that's kind of like the hotel.", "Oh yeah, I remember that one.  You're right; it is connected.", "And, I think The Simpsons did a parody actually called The Shining for one of their Halloween specials.", "Cool!  I'll have to check that one out!"], ["Do you like the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' movies?", "I do, I was always more of a 'Halloween' person though.", "So you like 'Freddy vs Jason'?", "I haven't seen it actually.

To see a film where you know the area super well.", "I also thought it was cool there were no opening credits like it just jumped right in.", "I don't know if I had taken not e of that while watching. I did find it captivating.", "Ya no opening credits and doesn't ever show the title of the film in it until the end.", "Iwonder why he made that choice, maybe because of the impact It Follows could have at the end?", "I think so, works so well with the entire movie plot."], ["What is your favorite movie?", "I like The Revenant.", "Oh yeah that is a good one.  Leo is so good in it.", "Yeah he won the Oscar for that role I believe.", "Yeah he did.  It took him forever to win one.", "Yeah but at least he won it for a good role instead of being given one later just because.", "True.", "So what is your favorite movie then?", "Mine is The Prestige.", "Oh I have never heard of that one."], ["Is the Conjuring series really based on a true story?", "Sort of. The characters are based on real people, Ed and Lorraine Warren, who claim to an exorcist and a psychic.", "The Amityville Haunting was also supposedly based on a true story, but it turned out to be hoax.", "It is hard to make a horror film that is an actual true story. What matters is if it feels real.", "Okay, so does The Conjuring series feel real?", "Almost, except the characters based on the Warrens are too perfect.", "What is a horror movie based on a true story that feels like it could have happened?", "I think Ti West's films qualify, like The Innkeepers.", "What is that about?", "It is filmed in a real inn that is supposedly haunted. Some employees try to see if they can prove it is, and then weird stuff happens."], ["What is the worst horror movie remake you have seen?", "That's a good question.  The first one that comes to mind is Nightmare on Elm Street.", "The one with Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger?", "Yes, that's the one.  It was scary, but they went too far into the back story.", "Yes, I didn't like the direction they took Freddy Krueger and the parents.", "That's because Wes Craven didn't have a part in the direction of this movie.", "It was interesting to learn about micro-naps in the movie.", "They did keep that part realistic.  That was actually a little scary thinking you could fall alseep without realizing it.", "The ending was kept similar though with Nancy's mom getting pulled by Freddy.", "The original was still better, even without today's digital effects."], ["I love the original Halloween.", "Me too. I watch it every year.", "I love his slow walk.", "It's very menacing.", "Michael Myers is a scary guy.", "He becomes a supernatural being.", "Does he?", "Yes, he never stops.

There were other things in the next couple decades, but the next heir apparent was probably Halloween -- which, coincidentally, stars Janet Leigh's daughter.", "Oh, yeah.

I hadn't thought of that before.", "Yeah, then Wes Craven sorta did a satire in Nightmare on Elm Street... then again, a decade later, with Scream.", "Those are satire? I mean, I guess Scream obviously is, but Nightmare?", "The first one, sure -- though the later ones didn't quite get the joke, aside from Robert Englund being a huge pot of overcooked ham.", "Now that you mention it, there was New Nightmare -- which... wasn't a satire, I guess, exactly, but it was... meta.", "Exactly.

Its great when vampires are actually scary and they aren't sparkling teenagers.", "I couldn't agree more!"], ["Have you seen the movie Get Out yet?", "No I haven't seen it. Is it as good as the hype?", "Even better. Jordan Peele did such a good job writing and directing that film.", "I heard that was his debut film too, is that right?", "That's true. And with him being a comedian it's surprising that he could delve into such dark territory.", "Right you are. I've been wanting to see it because I've heard so many positive things about it.", "It's filled with subliminal messages and little easter eggs to look for.", "Right and I did hear it was actually frightening. That means a lot since modern horror movies aren't scary anymore.", "This one definitely is.

One of the best in movie history.", "One criticism, the consistency could use some work.

It's my favorite movie of all time.", "What is so appealing about it?", "The grittyness and the creativity.", "What do you mean by that?", "Well, they had a limited budget so they never let you see the real evil spirit to maintain a constant tension.  They also got very creative for the special effects and makeup due to the low budget.  The film quality, or lack thereof, lent itself to the overall eerieness of the movie too.", "So nothing to do with the acting itself?", "No, the acting was also great.

Even Robert Englund plays himself.", "Whoa, that sounds meta! Does he still play Freddy or what?", "Yeah, but the Freddy that appears isn't the same as the one in the first movie.

It seems like there are a few new ones every month.", "I always associate these movies with Halloween and specific circumstances, but it's really an all year thing.", "I've only seen a few in theaters, but you're right, I don't think they were around Halloween.", "Have you seen The Grudge? I saw that one in the theater and couldn't ride an elevator alone for a few weeks after.", "That was a scary one. It was more something jumping out at you and surprising you than just being a scary concept.", "The Sixth Sense got me too.

How is that possible?", "I don't know. I guess I like watching people kill zombies, or zombies kill people but I don't like seeing people kill people.", "That's just wierd.", "Yeah, I guess it is.

Although, I did like all of the movies in the series.", "I didn't really like the second one as much as the rest, how about you?", "The second movie is definitely the worst in the series, but it's still fun to watch.

He also makes a cameo in the Freddy's Dead film, which I thought was awesome.", "Yeah, that movie was fun.

Probably won't have time to focus as much on the backstory of the characters.", "True,I hope they don't loose the essence of the story itself. But think it looks amazing.", "The new pennywise is super scary, I love tim curry but the updated version is even scary.", "Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd is set as pennywise in the new version. i don't know him to well, but think he will give a worthy show.", "He seems so young, but then you see him in the make up and trailer and he is so menacing.", "He really is.

Evil Dead is comedy-horror and Clive Barker is supernatural horror and body horror.", "Wow I didn't know that.  I just thought of it as creative horror.", "Well it has to do with what is causing the feeling of horror in you.", "The thing is, it doesn't cause horror as much to me.

I also thought overall that movie was great and underappreciated.", "Ya for such a well done film, did not really get the attention it deserved.", "They put a lot into authenticity of the film.", "How so?", "Well the dialect to start with, but even the costumes.

Only Ash remains--it can't be a remake with different characters, silly."], ["Have you seen the original Evil Dead?", "Yes the very definition of horror.", "It was awesome.

Lights Out is way better.", "What is it about?", "A young woman from a dysfunctional family reluctantly goes back to help her kid brother face a supernatural threat, while her mentally ill mother resists her.", "Is it a haunted house movie?", "Not exactly. The being can appear in different places, but only when the lights are out.", "That sounds like a childhood nightmare come to life!

There's a huge aura of mystery and the uneasiness I felt watching this was so terrifying it was good.", "Does the whole film take place in this coroners office?", "Pretty much, it takes place in the coroners office which gives it a creepy claustrophobic feel. The setup is very terrifying and the suspense as they're trying to figure out Jane's death is so unnerving.", "Is this more supernatural horror?", "There's definitely a supernatural horror element about this film. I won't spoil much but the first half of the movie during the autopsy on Jane is really startling with each discovery they find, and there's a lot of strange happenings that occur in the coroners office after the body arrives.", "This sounds really good. I'll have to give it a watch! I think I remember Andre Orvedal directed it, he did a fantastic job with his other movie called Troll Hunter. I'll have to look for this!"], ["Did you ever see any of the Poltergeist movies?", "Yes I've seen them all.

There were rumors that the movie was cursed.", "Right because I believe they were toying with subject matter along with relics that they shouldn't have.", "Part 3 wasn't all that good but it's still better than most modern horror movies.", "That's absolutely true.

I loved him as Dead Pool!", "Oh he is a great actor, but then so is Jake Gyllenhall. You won't be disappointed. And \"Life\" as a few good jump scares, but you will be fine.

Saturday won't come soon enough.", "Gives you something to look forwards too!"], ["Have you ever seen the Final Destination series?", "No, what's it about?", "It a really good horror series.

I did find the seventh one, The New Blood, interesting with Tina and her telekinetic powers.", "I think Friday the 13th Part 7, the New Blood, is definitely underrated. It gets a bad rap because the studio had to cut a lot of footage to get in to go into the ratings.", "I wish we got 7 in it's entirety some of the footage I saw looked pretty brutal.

It just helped set it up to be even better when it went so far out of normal horror movie territory.", "I sill do not quite understand how the ritual saves humanity, but I guess this time it didn't.", "No, Marty and Dana refuse to finish the ritual so that is the end of the Facility, and I assume the world if their rules are correct."], ["Bye Bye Man was the worst Horror movie I've ever seen!", "Oh yeah that movie was terrible, completely unoriginal and not to mention boring.", "Yeah totally, I saw Lights out though and though that was really good.", "Definitely, that one was really scary, by the same guy who made the Conjuring movies right?", "Yeah I think so.", "Conjuring two was pretty good I thought, did you see it?", "Yeah I liked it a lot, thought the monster looked a little cheesy though.", "Yeah I think so too, the nun wasn't very scary looking.

Any good?", "Not bad.  Spanish flick about a Satanic cult.", "Who is in the movie?", "Carlos Gallardo and Gizeht Galatea.", "I heard about her.  She's hot!", "Oh yes, and tough too.

It just looks okay, to be honest.", "Yeah, but I want to see it because it's pride month and apparently The Babadook is an LGBT horror movie.", "What? How does that even exist?", "Apparently there's some kind of underlying plot points which a lot of gay people familiarize with.", "For some reason I feel like the Babadook might be a monster coming out of the closet.", "No no, I don't think i will be that easy. I do know however that the Babadook does have jazz hands and a top hat.", "It does sound kind of good, and gay people tend to have good taste. There aren't a lot of gay horror movies, I think maybe Martyrs is the only other one I've seen.", "Martyrs? What's that about?", "Oh it's crazy. Probably one of the goriest movies I've ever seen.

How much was it like the classic Universal monster movies?", "Well, I definitely liked how they portrayed the Mummy.
