I've seen all the trailers.", "Do you think they will have all the old characters?", "I know it will have Luke Skywalker, Finn and Rey.", "Who are they fighting?", "I don't know.  There's not a lot of information about it.", "The island where they shot some of the scenes are amazing.", "Yes, I think they are in Ireland.", "This should really boost their tourism.", "Yes, they can call it Star Wars Tours."], ["I just came back from Seeing The Force Awakens. I don't understand why people think that Rey is a Mary Sue.", "Because she can do everything so easily, without any training.", "Yes, she did everything so quickly and so easily, like she was following some sort of quick and easy path.", "You think she's going Dark Side?", "Just watch it.  She's a huge ball of anger, and she uses the Force when he's angry, it's classic Dark Side.", "I don't think that's the intent.", "Maybe it wasn't, but the signs are there.  She doesn't start beating Kylo until she's angry. That's Dark Side right there.", "That's a good point.  Rey is flirting with the Dark Side.  I don't think the guys at Disney are that subtle, either.", "True. It's possible that they completely missed the point.  I wouldn't put that past them.

It introduced us to the space opera with wonderful characters that to this day remain relevant.", "That's true. I mean Luke Skywalker is going to be in the Last Jedi movie and Kylo Ren is Han Solo's son which makes Han Solo relevant despite his death.", "I wish they hadn't killed him off so quickly after introducing him in the Force Awakens.", "I guess they wanted to continue the story with a new generation of Jedi.", "Rey will make a great Jedi but they need to show more of her powers than they did in the Force awakens.", "Maybe that's the whole point of bringing Luke Skywalker back for the Last Jedi movie.", "I doubt he'll be as funny as Yoda was with him in the Empire Strikes Back.", "No one is as funny or as wise as Yoda!", "It'll be interesting to see how Luke and Rey's relationship unfolds in The Last Jedi."], ["Hey i got a question for you", "Sure you can ask anything you want", "Sure ok well first do you know some about star wars?", "Well yes i do who does not", "Well that is true", "So what is the question", "Is The Force Awakens just a retread", "I think it is it follows similar story beats", "Exactly some guy on reddit is disagreeing with me", "He is pretty wrong"], ["Who shot first: Greedo or Han?", "Obviously, Han shot first, no matter what George Lucas says.", "I agree.

I like the more gritty effect of the originals.", "Yeah, another thing I liked from the early versions was the painted backgrounds.", "Did they replace these with computer generated imagery?", "I don't know for sure, but they probably did.", "The Bespin Cloud City backgrounds were pretty cool, even if they looked like paintings.", "Definitely. I'd like to live in Bespin Cloud City."], ["What did you think of Rogue One?", "I was a little disappointed.", "What disappointed you?", "It was a little dull for me.", "Wow. I thought it was action packed.", "They spend most of the movie planning.", "I guess it does take a while for the action to get going.", "I also didn't care for the way they put Peter Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin in with digital effects.", "That wasy weird but the Dark Vader scene.", "OK, he totally kicked butt in that one scene."], ["Which movie is your favorite out of the Star Wars original trilogy?", "I definitely love Return of the Jedi the most out of the three!", "Why do you like Return of the Jedi more than the other two movies?", "It is because it is the final showdown between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader/Sith Lord.", "I think the final fight scene between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader/Sith Lord was awesome!", "So do I! The special effects back then were amazing!", "The Sith Lord's lightning powers were very cool to look at.", "I especially love when the Sith Lord was thrown over the railing.", "I was shocked that happened because I thought it would be Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader to die.", "So was I, I had to watch that scene a couple more times."], ["Hi friendo", "Hey there", "Whatcha doing", "I am watching star wars episode 3", "That was such a good movie", "Honestly it was one of the best in the series", "Easily the best in the prequel trilogy", "Overall i mean", "I mean it is in the top 3 maybe not top though", "Well i can agree to that."], ["Did you see the latest Star Wars?", "Yeah I thought it wasnt that great.", "Why do you say that?", "I think the acting was lacking.", "You might be the only one to say that.", "Maybe, but its the truth.", "Did you want more of the original cast?", "No I think they all showed up right.", "How about James Earl Jones?", "Now that would have been comedy."], ["They should bring back Mace Windu.", "He's dead, though.  You can't get deader than falling out a window like that.", "Luke fell out of Cloud City.  And yet, he lived.", "Luke had Leia to pick him up.", "First he used the Force to guide himself into a chute that opened at an improbable moment.  Mace is better than that. He could have one of those flying cars.", "That is more plausible than Darth Maul's survival, and hurts the story less.", "They'll probably bring him back for Episode 9.", "I think they'd use  him in Rebels, instead,", "Rebels can't afford Samuel L. Jackson.", "They can't afford a lot of people.

What do you think of Rey, who is she related to?", "I have my theories, some may assume is Han and Leia\u00b4s daughter.

The huge battle on Naboo with he Trade Federation was amazing!", "But Jar Jar ruined the movie.", "But Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala saved it, for sure!", "Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn was pretty cool too.", "If you are into dudes, I guess so.  Bet you liked Anakin Skywalker, too.", "He is the bot that becomes Darth Vader, how can you not?", "I'm not fan of the Dark Side, so I am on team Luke.", "That means you get Yoda, too.  That is a good play.", "But also Jar Jar.  So maybe Droids and TIE Fighters are the right path"], ["What Star Wars character do you dislike the most?", "I really don't like Jar Jar Binks!", "Why don't you like that character?", "Jar Jar Binks is just really annoying!", "I also find Jar Jar Binks extremely annoying.", "I think they just added Jar Jar Binks as a comic relief character.", "Yes I totally agree with you!", "There are moments I found funny when I saw Jar Jar Binks on screen.", "The way Jar Jar Binks says \"me\" as \"meesa\" makes me laugh.", "It also makes me laugh!"], ["Did anyone really think Luke was a little short to be a stormtrooper?", "Yeah... I know!  No, he could have decently passed for a storm trooper!", "In fact, he had!  Or so I thought.  He was traipsing around the Death Star with Han Solo in storm trooper gear for a while before they managed to make it--basically un-harrassed--to the detention level.  So I would say he DIDN'T draw attention to himself for being short.", "Maybe the purpose of that line Princess Leia used, \"Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?\" was in there to draw attention to, or further emphasize, the fact that Luke was basically still a teenager...a kid.  Lots of references to this throughout the film.  For example, Han Solo regularly refers to Luke as \"kid...\"", "You're probably right.  I just can't help but think Leia's line there could have been so much more dramatic--even humorous...", "Well, the banter between Obi Wan Kenobi, too, could have used some serious tinkering, too", "I guess, overall, at the end of the day--while the original Star Wars trilogy had it's \"meh\" dialogue moments and lackluster acting-- it STILL, by far, outshines the later prequels George Lucas decided to crank out", "Still nauseated at the over-complicated, boring, political plots and sub-plots that just made most Star Wars' fans miserable...the original trilogy had light-saber-induced limb amputations and surprise familial twists, etc.  The prequels had...what..votes of no confidence in the freakin' senate, and toddler-Vader pod racing and yee-hawing in the desert?  It...there just is no....I mean...is NOTHING sacred?", "Jar Jar action figures and lunch boxes...the HUMANITY!!", "I know!  Let's hope that DIsney makes it stop....please no more Star Wars abominations and atrocities...!!"], ["I am not sure if i still like the old movies as much as the old ones?", "Why not", "The old ones seem kind of dated", "You are crazy", "No i am dead serious", "Well then you sir are insane", "Well if you think so", "How could you like the travesty better", "Which one is the  travesty", "How dare you now know!"], ["What about the prequels, which one was your favorite?", "I guess the 3rd one; I forgot what it's called.", "Why that one?", "Because it was dark and had some tense moments.", "What was wrong with the other 2 prequels.", "Come on seriously.

There are so many.", "How far did you get in the series?", "I only got to the fourth movie, The Phantom Menace.", "That was a great movie.", "Yes, it was.

Who was yours?", "Hans Solo, But also like CP3O."], ["In the new Star Wars movie, why is Klyo so crazy about a grandpa he never met.", "They never really say, I imagine he thinks they have something in common.", "Why? I mean he has powers but no one made him dark.", "He is very powerful, but the dark side has more power.", "So, maybe he wanted to have more power, make his grandpa proud.", "Maybe, even though Vader turned good at the end.", "He even visited Luke in a, what is that, a force ghost?", "Yes, on Endorine. At the part, he did so that means he some how died a Jedi.", "Even though he lived most his life as a sith.", "He began the turn long before he got the mask."], ["Who do you like better, R2-D2 or BB-8?", "Man that's a tough one!", "You have to chose one or the other!", "I will always love R2-D2, but as of right now, I like BB-8 more.", "Why do you like BB-8 more?", "I guess BB-8 has more of a personality than R2-D2.", "I agree with you!", "BB-8's interactions with everyone was hilarious.", "My favorite part when when BB-8 gave Finn a thumbs up.", "That was so cute!"], ["Who shot first?", "What do you mean?", "Han Solo or Greedo?", "Still confused?", "Did you ever see A New Hope?", "Star Wars?", "Yeah.", "Yes...", "Remeber in the cantina?", "Oh, yeah!

I like the sound of they make on the floor.", "Did you like Finn as a stormtrooper?", "I thought it was an interesting inclusion.  It's good to see more diversity in the First Order.", "Yeah, the rebel alliance is so much more diverse.  They even have interspecies commanders.", "Like the fish.", "That's exactly what I was thinking.", "Diversity for the universe!"], ["Did you like Bobba Fett from Star Wars?", "Yes, he was a great character, but when he was introduced in the Empire Strikes Back he did not have that many scenes.", "I agree. I wish they gave him more screen time. Even in Return of the Jedi, he did not as much time on screen as he should have.", "I was really upset when he fell into the Sarlacc pit in The Return of The Jedi.", "I thought that was terrible, also. Jango Fett, who was Bobba's father in Star Wars: Attack of The Clones, had a really cool look to his armor because it was nice and shiney.", "Yes, but Bobba, I felt, had a better looking armor because it was more worn, like he had seen a lot of battles.", "They both looked completely the same because Bobba was a clone of his father.", "That's true because Bobba Fett and the Clone Troopers were clones of Jango.", "Bobba Fett was closest to Jango because Jango didn't want him altered like the Clone Troopers were.", "yep because Jango wanted a son and someone who was just like he was. Bobba and Jango were great characters and I wish they would have lasted throughout the entire second trilogy and they would have shown Bobba become a bounty hunter."], ["Luke should have had a bigger role in The Force Awakens.", "Yeah, it doesn't make any sense that he'd just stay out there on an island for decades.", "Yeah. It's incredibly irresponsible, if you think about it.", "Certainly.  Luke from Return of the Jedi wouldn't have just ran away, he would have gone there and grabbed Kylo by the ear and brought him back home.", "It's not like he could have been scared of Snoke. Snoke is nothing compared to Palpatine, and Luke confronted him without hesitating.", "They were probably trying to do the Yoda thing.", "But Yoda had an excuse, he was really old, and on his last legs. He also lost when he fought Palpatine. And originally, he wasn't even supposed to be a fighter.", "Luke doesn't have those excuses, does he? Maybe Snoke did beat him.", "If that's the case, then they have to show it.  It's also implausibly. Luke was one of the best.", "He wasn't that good. He was only half trained."], ["Do you think the ghost of Yoda will be in the next movie?", "I sure hope so, that little alien is my favorite.", "Mine too! I love when he is in the swamp and he has gone slightly mad.", "Right? Like, if I was Like and showed up and this slightly crazy alien was supposed to help me, I'd be a little worried.", "Yeah, but he couldn't leave because his ship was sunk in the mud.", "I love the part where Yoda is digging through his food.", "There was probably not a lot of good snacks in the swamp.", "Maybe Yoda was looking for Space Doritos.", "He could use the force to make them appear.", "I'm pretty sure it doesn't work like that. Unless your midichorians are really off the scale."], ["Who was the better mentor to Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi or Yoda?", "Of course Yoda is the better mentor!", "Why is Yoda the better mentor?", "It's because Obi Wan Kenobi got killed by Darth Vader in the first movie.", "Ah, that's true.", "Right! Obi Wan Kenobi did not really teach Luke Skywalker anything before he died.", "I think he told him about the force.", "He did, but Yoda was the one who helped train Luke Skywalker.", "It would of been better if he was trained by the both of them at the same time.", "Yes! He would have better skills."], ["When did you first see Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope?", "I saw it in 1977.", "I wasn't even born then!

But I think I would have liked Luke.", "I did want to look like Princess Leia, though.", "What about her appealed to you?", "She was beautiful AND strong AND capable.", "Yeah.  So sad that Carrie Fisher passed away, though.", "Yeah. And it makes me feel old!"], ["Do you think Han Solo is the best Star Wars character?", "I think so. He has a really interesting arc in the first one.", "I agree, the way he goes from a non caring space pirate to a friend is awesome.", "Did you like him in The Empire Strikes Back?", "Yes, although he did not have as big of an arc.", "Yeah, the first one developed his character a lot more.", "Did you like him in Return of the Jedi?", "Yes, but I think they should have killed him off.", "I heard that is what he wanted in the third film.", "Yes, but I think someone decided it was better to keep his character alive."], ["I hate Star Wars.", "Why? What's wrong with it.", "I just don't think it's a good show. It's too childish.", "Well, lots of kids grew up with Star Wars in the 80's and 90's.", "Don't you think the plots are too basic?", "Star Wars was one of the first shows to do good vs. evil. It's a classic", "Classically bad.", "Well don't discount other people's tastes. Don't go to the dark side.", "The dark side. Really? Do I get to use the force in the dark side.", "Not if I use the force on you first."], ["If you had to pick a Star Wars film to remove from the genre, what would it be?", "That is hard, I would have to say episode one.", "Why is that? I like that one.", "I did not like the character, ahem, Jar Jar Binks ring any bells?", "I think he is underrated, he provided comic relief.", "He was funny sure, but did he have to be in the movie for the plot to progress?", "He did to go see the under water group.", "No, Jar Jar was an outcast. They would have seen them either way.", "Wow, you are right. Well, any other issues.", "They focused on  a child too much, made it seem like a kid's film."], ["If you could be one character from star wars movies , who would it be?", "Since I am female  I would have to say lea.", "Really why? The new females are so much more empowered.", "Well I loved the original star wars movies the most. I also love that gold bikini and adore Han solo.", "Fair enough reasons. The other newer females don't really have any love interest do they?", "Well with rae she sort of does, but not as clear if that will develop or not. But not as overt.", "That is true, I was just thinking we left out the whole romance of queen amidala.", "Oh yes, I did blank on that.

But like I said glad they ended it the way they did had so much impact.", "Yes, it was certainly impactful, I cried.", "It was one of my favorite films of the star wars world.", "I think it was executed so well and the script was written so well too. Everything in the movie felt truly captivating."], ["Do you prefer the new Star wars, the old Star Wars or the ones in the middle?", "I think the old star wars, Luke, Leai and Hans, are best.", "They had a good bit of story to dig into.", "It was the relationships, like Han and Leai, the slow burn into love.", "Their relationship really played out well, I was invested.", "The witty come back between the two always made me smile, like they really did like one another.", "I like that they came from world apart.", "Yes, he was a bit of a scoundrel and her a princess, it was a wrong side of the tracks love.", "Did you like the part when he was about to be frozen and she said she loved him.", "And he said, \"I know\", got me everytime."], ["What is your favorite Star Wars movie?", "I like The Emperor Strikes Back.", "Oh, that's a classic!", "I like all the classics, but that's my favorite one.", "Do you like any of the modern ones?", "I like Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, despite what the reviewers said.", "I like that movie too!

A perfect name for something epic.", "Yeah, I like how symbolic Star Wars is.", "Yeah I feel like Star Wars just focuses on being symbolic. Like their characters.", "And their font.

Number one: the CGI effect allowed for more creatures, more beautiful landscapes, more action than ever before.", "Okay, I'll give you that one. The Naboo landscapes were gorgeous, and the underwater Gungan City were phenomenal. Reason number two?", "It showed the origins of Anakin Skywalker, and the real reason why he turned to the dark side in the other films.", "The real reason? Do you mean that he turned to the dark side when Padme was killed?", "No, no, that's not what I mean. I mean, Anakin was never supposed to be a Jedi. He was never supposed to be good.

It felt very tense and exciting.", "The Battle of Endor was the conclusion to the trilogy. And it was very well-acted.", "That battle was complicated, though. Hoth was very straightforward.", "It wasn't that complicated. Alliance commandos were fighting stormtroopers.", "On Hoth, stormtroopers were taking over the Alliance base on Hoth, while the Rebels evacuated.", "The snowspeeder fight was interesting to watch, for sure.", "My favorite part is using tow cables to destroy the AT-ATs."], ["Do you know how Star Wars changed the toy industry?", "They increased the sales of figure toys?", "Not exactly. They promoted the idea of a female character action figure, which had always been lacking before.", "Do you mean Princess Leia?", "No, Rey from The Force Awakens. Before her, there were rarely female action figures, because they just didn't sell well.", "And Rey was so popular it changed the demand?", "Yes. People had complained before about not being able to find female character figures, and even leading up to the movie there was no Rey. But after the movie came out, she was on everything, and outsold everyone except the villian character.", "I bet the times had a lot to do with the change.

It wasn't credible.", "I know it was kind of weird that Amidala was so much older than Anakin.", "Unfortunately, the age difference was compounded when they were both adults, because Amidala was so responsible and aware, and Anakin was a complainy mopey baby.", "I wonder what George Lucas was thinking. Here was the future Darth Vader, and he needed all the positive lovable qualities he could get, to make his seduction by the Dark Side all the more tragic.", "You could say, but wait, Amidala fell in love with him, so that means he's wonderful! But if a relationship is not based in credible reality, the whole thing just feels contrived - which this did.", "I must admit, I'm hard pressed to list any quality of Anakin's that would compel a beautiful princess to fall in love with him.", "And the effectiveness of the whole trilogy, and the tragedy of Anakin becoming Darth, hinges on that relationship.

I would tell everyone that I was Vader.", "Me too!  But apparently, they don't want their child to connect him to one of the most villainous characters of all time.", "I guess I can agree with that.  But I would still want to say the occasional, \"I am your father,\" in Vader's voice to my kid.", "I agree.  That would be cool.", "Hayden Christensen always seemed to reject his connection to Star Wars, so I'm not super surprised.", "People didn't like the way he portrayed Anakin in Episode's 2 & 3, but I thought he was good.", "I think he was good too.
