{"conversations": [["Well, I let my kids watch all of the Harry Potter movies finally.", "Really? What did they think of them?", "They were hooked from the first scene of Sorcerer's Stone.", "That is not suprising.

Why him?", "I am not sure.

And how it seems that Vodly is destined to come back.", "I know what you mean.  And that book, how innocent people can just be controlled by Voldy.", "And the part about parcil mouths.  It was cool how only a select few can speak to snakes.", "That was one of Voldemort's best showings at the end.  Seems he got much closer to victory the second time around.", "Yes, to see him young, and get a glimpse of his planning abilities.", "I also liked the Griffendore sword.", "Yeah, it was pretty cool.  Gave a warm feeling to the end as well."], ["We had a Harry Potter movie marathon this weekend.", "That sounds like it was fun.", "It was and it was relaxing too.", "I need to do more of that kind of binge watching.", "It makes all of the movies make sense when you watch them in order.", "I think that is so true.", "I love this series because the story is complex.", "I think it works well with following Harry's Hogwart years.", "Yes that takes talent to record them and make the actors seem like not a lot has passed.", "I imagine that they all became very close when recording the movie."], ["Have you seen that new game, Bean Boozled?", "Yeah, the Jelly Belly game?", "That's the one.", "What of it?", "It reminds me of Harry Potter.", "How so?", "You remember the first movie, when they're on the train?", "Oh, yeah. With the gross flavored jelly beans?", "Uh huh.", "Your right!"], ["Did you ever feel in the Order of the Phoenix that Harry would end up with Luna?", "You mean because of the ending of that one?", "It was such a cute moment, and I thought for sure it meant that Harry and Luna would have a thing later on.", "They were both from too sad of a background I think. But, I did like that moment.", "There were some really small moments in the films that always got me.", "I liked when Mr. Weasly was so excited to ask Haryy questions.", "And he was so happy, he just over looked the fact that Harry was more of less a famous guy.", "When he asked \" What exactly is the purpose of a rubber ducky?\", I crack up every time!", "I think he was one of the best. He always made the show feel lighter.", "I loved when he just left the flying car sitting around. Like it was a normal machine."], ["I like when they go to Hogsmeade", "Its so cool that they get to take field trips when they are at hogwarts.", "I agree", "I feel bad when Harry doesnt have a permission slip so he cant go", "Me too", "But im glad he finally got to go.", "Same here, they shouldnt punish him because his parents died", "Exactly", "I really like these movies", "Me too"], ["You know something", "What?", "Hagrid is scary", "From harry potter?", "Yeah in the movies he scared me as a kid", "Well i mean he is imposing", "Yeah and huge", "Well thats what i meant he did not scare me though", "He sorta does still scare me a little though", "That is silly"], ["I just watched the last two Harry Potter movies.", "Oh my gosh! What did you think!?", "I was really pleased with it. I'm glad they split it into two parts to cover more, since the book was so long.", "Yeah, it's nice now that we can watch them together, but it was awful when part one had come out and part two hadn't yet!", "Did you see them in theaters?", "I saw part one on opening night, but I saw part two in theaters a few weeks after it came out.", "What was it like when Dobby died at the end of part one?", "The whole theater was crying!

He was so weird looking.", "I think that's why.", "He did look as if he could be a rat.", "Indeed!"], ["I don't think that Hogwarts should keep Slytherin house around - all the wizards that came out of there were evil.", "Not all Slytherins are evil. Snape wasn't evil.", "Snape wasn't evil exactly, but he wasn't actually a good guy. He treated his students really unfairly.", "Yeah, but he was basically a double agent, fighting against the most powerful evil wizard in the world.", "Okay, but all the other Slytherins were evil.", "Do you think Horace Slughorn was evil?", "He was very selfish and narcissistic.", "I don't think that makes someone evil - he still tried to help his students.", "He only cared about protecting himself and \"collecting\" students.", "I still don't think that makes him evil. All people are a little selfish."], ["So you think Haggrid and Madame Maxime got together after everything was settled?", "Good question. I think we all just assumed Haggrid was still game keeper at Hogwarts.", "Yeah, probably. How do you think the Fantasical Beasts tie in to that?", "It would have been cool for Haggrid to meet Newt Scramander. I think they would have had a lot to talk about.", "Yeah, that new movie was pretty good. I'm not sure how I feel about the Cursed Child.", "It sounded a little to far off base for me. Like the description of Harry sounded completely out of character.", "I thought so too, but I'll probably still go see it. I love the Harry Potter movies though they are different from the books.", "Yeah, it's a different vibe but still good.", "They did an excellent job with special effects.", "Considering how vivid the descriptions are in the book and how my imagination wandered...they did great."], ["Is it just me or is Luna crazy?", "Well, her dad's a nutcase.", "I know, but she could have been a bit more sane.", "Hard to be sane when you're dad is a complete loon.", "I did like the actress' performance though.", "Yeah, she did a good job of just looking around quite a bit bewildered.", "I wish she would have been in the last movie more.", "Yeah, I guess they had too much to wrap up.", "Didn't she end of marrying someone at Hogwarts?", "I'm not sure to be honest."], ["I am missing out", "Can you tell me what you are missing", "I realize i have missed a few of the movies", "What ones", "I never watched both parts of the deathly hollows", "Well why do we not fix this then", "Do you own them", "I think i do", "Well find them please", "Sure and we can watch them"], ["So my wife want's to watch Harry Potter tonight but I feel i'm too old to watch the movies what do you think?", "No way those movies are actually just as good for adults", "Really?  I thought it looked pretty lame on the trailers", "No there is a lot of cool magic and visual effects", "I guess I can give them a try", "Just keep an open mind, even though kids are doing the magic there are also teachers that are adults and some pretty notable actors are in the series", "Like who?", "Gary Oldman is in at least 3 or 4 of them", "Really, he's a great actor, you may have sold me on him alone", "there you go, now go and enjoy the movies with your wife"], ["So who's your favorite Harry Potter character?", "Severus Snape.", "What?! He was a nasty character who bullied Harry and his friends for years!", "Yes, but he was also trying to protect them even though the experience was extremely painful for him.", "Okay, I know it wasn't easy, but did he have to be so mean?", "Harry was a living, breathing reminder of everything he'd lost. You can't blame him for having negative feelings toward him.", "Yeah, maybe that's true.", "Besides, he couldn't have been nice to Harry, even if he'd wanted to.", "Why do you say that?", "Because hating Harry, or at least pretending to, was a crucial part of maintaining his cover with Voldemort."], ["Who is your least favorite character in the Harry Potter series?", "I really don't like Peter Pettigrew. He betrayed the Potters and ultimately helped Voldemort come back to power.", "Yeah, and then he was so close to Harry throughout most of his time at Hogwarts but Harry didn't even know.", "Wait, what do you mean he was close to Harry?", "Peter Pettigrew was Ron's rat, Scabbers! He was an Animagus.", "Oh, you're right! Now I remember. Whenever they would look at the Maurader's Map, they'd see Ron sleeping next to someone named Wormtail and be confused.", "Who do you think your favorite character is?", "I love both of the Weasley twins. I can't handle at the end of the last movie when Fred dies.", "I know. I thought that was one of the saddest parts of the entire series.", "So many people died at the Battle of Hogwarts. There's one shot of Colin Creevy, that little boy who always had a camera, and that always makes me sad."], ["What did you think of the first Deathly Hallows?", "It was pretty good.  It's amazing to see how quickly the wizarding world fell.", "Proof to how powerful Voldemort really is.", "Yeah, baldy is pretty powerful.  And clearly has agents everywhere.", "The cliffhanger at the end was insane too.", "When Voldemort gets the Elder Wand?", "Yes!  How are they going to battle that powerful wizard with that powerful object?", "The parts about the Deathly Hallows was cool too.", "Yeah, seeing the history of these objects.", "I'd even someday like to see more on their history and former owners."], ["I am so sad", "Why", "Because two of the best harry potter actors have died", "Which ones", "The one who played dumbledore and snape", "I thought only one died", "No they both are dead now", "That is sad", "I know right", "Such a shame"], ["What did you think of Goblet of Fire?", "It was really good.  These movies seem to get better and better with each one.", "Yeah, the fight scenes and action took a big step forward.", "It was funny to watch the guys go crazy over asking girls out too.  Glad I'm not a teen anymore.", "Yeah, and lets not forget the maze at the end.", "Who would have expected that lead to a port key?", "I know right?  And to the worst possible place.", "I know, I felt bad for Cedric.  But that fight with Voldemort was pretty cool.", "I know right?  It was one of the best parts.", "Especially when Peter cut off his own hand."], ["So, I just saw the whole Harry Potter series, again, for the second time.", "What did you think the second time round?", "There was a lot of deep stuff I missed the first time.", "Like what?", "Well, for one that Luna can see the ghost horses only those whom have seen death can.", "Yep, shows she has seen some awful things.", "Then it went on to show her life at home, her dad seemed off.", "I think that is what made her complex. She was more than just a kid, she had seen a lot of death and sadness.", "But she still kept the sort of sad but happy tone to herself.", "I think it was meant to show that even young people can grown from despair, it changes them, but they can still be happy in their selves."], ["Which of the Harry Potter movies was your favorite?", "You know I really liked the Prisoner of Azkaban. That movie and book marked a poignant time in the characters direction.", "Yeah, it definitely took a turn for the dark. I kind of think as far as the movies, the first was really good.", "It was. The special effects were amazing. I really enjoyed seeing everything I imagine happening before me.", "the special effects kept getting better and better I thought.", "I thought so too.", "My only question is that when they could do all these things and it look so good. Why did Voldemort look so lame?", "I know right? He is not what I imagined either.", "If they can put a dead guys face on someone else....", "I know! And they've done it several times! I think they missed the mark on that one."], ["Are thier any good thiller moviers out now", "Over the weekend i watch harry potter", "Yeah man he's good", "It had me on the edge of my seat", "Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food", "It wasn't funny at all just creepy", "It was really scary", "And creepily", "On Saturday i will see something funny", "But this movie was not bad"], ["What's your favorite Harry Potter book?", "I love the Prisoner Of Azaban", "Who is your favorite character in that book?", "Serious Black", "What do you like abour Serious?", "I like how he turned out to be the good guy", "Yes. Any other characters?", "I liked Hermione in this one.", "Why is that?", "I loved her time changer"], ["Do you remember the flying car scene in Harry Potter I believe it was in Chamber of Secrets.", "No what flying car scene?", "You know the one where Ron returns and Harry is saved?", "Barely can you give a bit more detail?", "The car was a Ford Anglia and Harry was trying to escape the Hursleys, ringing a bell?", "Oh yeah I remember now.", "I just finished watching that scene and had to pause the movie.", "Why?", "So I could ask you about it and tell you it was awesome.", "Okay now i'm getting nostalgic."], ["What's your favorite Harry Potter movie?", "I love them all, but I think my favorite would have to be \"Half-Blood Prince.\"", "Oh yeah, I love that one too.  I especially like the romance between Ron and Lavender Brown.", "Me too!  All the kids are growing up and really starting to notice the opposite sex in that one.", "The relationship between Ron and Lavender is kind of the spark that gets Ron and Hermione together.", "And then there's Harry and Ginny--they get together in this one too.", "There really is a lot that goes on in \"Half-Blood Prince.\"", "Yep.  You find out about the horcruxes, you're introduced to Professor Slughorn . . .", "Malfoy joins the death eaters and Dumbledore dies at the end . . .", "Yes, it's really an emotional roller coaster.  There's humor, passion, terror, and finally grief all rolled into one great movie!"], ["What is your least favorite character in the Harry Potter series?", "I would say Draco Malfoy.", "Yeah hes a real douche of a character.", "As much as I don't like him, he did seem to have somewhat of a heart in the last movie.", "I think so too, but he was still young and didn't make any really life changing decisions yet.", "What about Neville Longbottom?", "I loved that character, how he was such a dork and clumsy.", "He really ended up being a badass though towards the end of the series.", "Yeah like how he stood up to lord voldemort.", "That part of the movie was truly awe inspiring."], ["What do you think the saddest part of the series is?", "It's a toss up between the death of Dumbledore or Fred's death.", "The whole Dumbledore death and lead up was phenomenally done.", "Agreed, from the cave scene on I had a feeling but I didn't think it would happen.", "Then Dumbledore begging for death when Harry forced the potion down his throat. Heartbreaking.", "Oh that part killed me. Then when they get back and get to the tower.", "Oh no! I always hated Malfoy, but in that moment I'm not sure if I hated him or pitied him.", "Clearly he's despicable, but I felt for him a little too.", "Then, with his final act of power, Dumbledore keeps Harry bound under the cloak.", "And Harry only realizing he was free because Dumbledore had died. Oh, I hated it so much but it was so well done."], ["What did you think of The Prisoner of Azkaban?", "I thought it was pretty cool to start putting things like werewolves in there.", "I know, too bad for that Professor Lupin though.  He was awesome.", "Yeah, very powerful and pretty good with the kids as well.  He would have taught them well.", "I didn't expect Scabbers to be Peter Petigrew the whole time.", "I know, how fitting he was a rat.", "Also that Serious Black was a good guy.  They put some good plot twist in there.", "I agree, he's a good character too.", "One of the best ones.  And best friends with Harry's father.", "Yeah, him, Lupin, and that rat Peter.  I hate him."], ["Have you seen all off the Harry Potter movies?", "Hell yeah, they are some of my favorite all time movies.", "Mine too, I loved the whole series.  The way they brought it to live was amazing.", "I know, they did a great job of making you feel like it was real.", "The Deathly Hallows part two was a great ending to the series.", "I agree, they did a great job of bringing the book to life.", "I wish they would make more.  Know that Harry is older and a father, I would love to see a new movie.", "Me to, He could be a teacher or the Headmaster now.", "I hate that Dumbledore died.  I loved him.", "Yes, the character and the actor were awesome."], ["I noticed the other day that there was a Harry Potter marathon on, I got sucked into Goblet of Fire.", "Ooo, I loved that one!", "I love all the challenges that the kids do.", "Which was your favorite?", "I like the scene in the lake.

I want a baby dragon.", "Did you notice who Cedric Diggory is? It's the guy from Twilight.", "I forgot about that. I loved his character in Harry Potter, he acted it really well.", "Yes, I was really sad when he died."], ["I'm pretty sure Voldemort has some nice qualities to him.", "You're insane.", "Hear me out.  He had a bad childhood, right?", "Right.", "He was an orphan, right?", "Right.", "Well, Harry was the same way so why does he get a free pass?", "Because Harry was never evil at heart.", "But maybe Voldemort wasn't either when he was very young.", "Well, Voldemort's dead, so end of discussion."], ["Have you seen Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban?", "Yeah I have ! That's probably my favorite!", "Really ? Why? That's my least.", "I love that they travel back in time !", "I personally prefer the goblet of fire.

It's also pretty scary, that graveyard scene was done well.", "Poor Harry having to experience that.", "I would be so traumatized watching that death.", "Me too. And to come back with the body like that."], ["Have you watched all the Harry Potter movies yet?", "Yes, I finally finished and I'm so sad there are no more!", "Which one was your favorite?", "Goblet of Fire! So much happened and poor Cedric.", "Oh gosh I cried so much when he died.", "He didn't deserve that! Voldemort is horrible!", "I know right? So is Bellatrix though!", "When she killed Sirius I almost died!", "I cried for like 5 days!", "Harry Potter is awesome though!"], ["Do you like Harry Potter?", "It's okay.", "I watched the first four in the theater.", "They kept getting darker.", "J.K. Rowling is a great writer.", "It's a great concept.", "It was fun to live vicariously through the characters.", "The wizards had no cares in the world.", "I'd like to magic some things.", "That would be nice."], ["So I had a Harry Potter marathon the other day.", "Really? How many did you watch?", "I watched all eight, it took all day.", "That is crazy, which one is your favorite?", "I like the last one, the battle at Hogwarts is just so epic!", "I like that one too, so much better than the Deathly Hallows Part 1.", "Yes!

It's a movie!", "Yeah, I know, but isn't it a little creepy to marry someone who was so crazy about you that she was lured to the chamber of secrets?", "You do have a point there . . .", "And her brother was a pseduo-brother for Ron.", "I get your point.  Like they were kind of like family.", "Yeah.  I mean, he didn't have to end up with anyone from Hogwarts."], ["Have you seen any Harry Potter movies?", "Of course, I am a huge fan!", "Oh sweet!

First time in hundreds of years!", "Yeah, well they probably got enough cash to store a whole section of old out of print books!", "It would have been pretty cool to work on the set.

I'm actually sad that they have ended!  I loved how it ended though!  Lord Voldemort got his behind handed to him!", "Yes he did!  The Deathly Hallows part two was definitely my all time favorite movie of the series!", "Mine too!  They ended those movies so good!  Have you read any of the books?", "I have!  Believe it or not, the books are even better!", "I've heard that!  They say that about a lot of your book made movies.  They always say the books are better.", "They really are especially in the case of the Harry Potter books.  There is so much more going on in them."], ["So I hear Dumbledore is gay?", "Yeah, I heard about that. Jk Rowling was all over that in an interview.", "That's pretty cool. Hogwarts is in to diversity.", "So you think there was anything going on with Grindlewald?", "I don't know. It makes their interaction more interesting and tragic.", "Yeah, it seems Dumbledore was dealing with his baggage his whole life.", "Yeah, kind of makes it real.", "Yeah and contemporary in way.", "Never thought about that but you're right.", "So many layers to Harry Potter. I get something out of it every time."], ["I just got to the end of The Goblet of Fire.", "What do you think so far.", "I never saw the plot with Barty Crouch Jr. pretending to be Moody coming.", "That was pretty insane especially since he acted just like the real Moody.", "I thought it was hilarious when he turned Malfor into a ferret.", "I nearly died laughing.", "IT was nice how he comforted Neville.", "What happened to his parents was pretty sad.", "I still can't believe Cedric died though.", "Me either Hufflepuff doesn't get much attention."], ["Did you know that it has been ten years since the last Harry Potter book was released?", "Has it been that long already? Wow!", "Yes, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released in 2007.", "I can't believe it has been so long.", "I remember that on the day it was released, I went to the book store dressed as Professor Dumbledore.", "I never dressed up for the book releases, but I did dress as Harry Potter for Halloween when I was a kid.", "People always dressed up for the book releases. My mom dressed as Professor Mcgonogal once.", "My mom never read any of the Harry Potter books.", "My mom was a bigger Harry Potter fan than I was!", "Wow, you're so lucky."], ["I just finished Prisoner of Azkaban, have you read it?", "Yeah, it's one of my favorites.", "Okay, so what did you think of Sirius?", "I like him quite a bit, but he's a bit odd. What do you mean?", "Well, the Harry/Sirius dynamic is a bit, strange.", "Well, I think it would be that way with any nephew and uncle who have never really met (except when Harry was a baby).", "True, I guess I just thought it seemed sudden.", "It really was, but still it's essential to the story.", "I just really hate Snape and how smug and haughty he was the entire time.", "Yeah, Sirius definitely didn't deserve that."], ["What was your favorite part about Order of the Phenix?", "I liked the scenes practicing in the room or requirement.", "That was pretty cool, and seeing all the different Petronus.", "I also liked how Harry finally got the girl.", "Yeah that was great.  At least for a couple seconds it was.", "We got a good look at Luna too, she's quite the character.", "Tell me about it, she's a little strange but adds depth to the show.", "Yeah, not everyone is big family somewhat normal Rob, or perfect little Harmine.", "I also liked Dumpledore's escape.", "Yep, that one guy was right.  He sure knows how to make an exit."], ["Hi.", "Hey.", "What was your favorite harry potter?", "Movie or book?", "Movie.", "I like the prisoner of azkabahn.", "That was a really great one.", "Yeah loved it.  What about you?", "I don't think I have a favorite.", "oh okay."], ["My favorite part of Harry Potter is the sorting ceremony", "That part is cool", "The hat is so neat", "It is, i love how you can hear what its thinking", "Me too", "And he can hear what your thinking", "Oh yea", "When harry was saying not slytherin", "And the hat heard him", "So he got put in griffindor"], ["Hey, Melanie and I are starting the Harry Potter series of movies. Care to join us?", "Do you mean all of them?", "Yes, we were going to watch the first one The Sorcerers Stone tonight?", "There are a lot of movies but I could for sure be there to watch one at a time. That's a great idea!", "Yes, and we are both going to dress as our idea of Hermoine.", "That sounds fun, I can do that. Maybe we could switch characters for every movie.", "That's a great idea. And make snacks to go along with the movie.", "I can do that. What should I bring?", "Well how about some kind of Halloween snack since it has that feast in the movie?", "Great idea! I will make pumpkin cookies!"], ["I hated the second Dumbledore?", "The actor or are you talking about Albus'  brother?", "No, the actor.", "I agree. The first one was much better. But what can you do. He died.", "I know. Why did the second one always have his beard in a braid. I hated that thing.", "You get upet about the smallest things.", "It annoyed me.", "It annoyed me that they didn't do a very good job making the movie. Dumbledore's beard, I don't really care about.", "You don't like Harry Potter?", "I'm not a big fan of the movies. I loved the books."], ["I just saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1.", "I didn't like them making two movies out of one book.", "Yes, it's all about the money.", "Any good scenes?", "I like when they made six decoy Potters.", "Cool.  What was the group Harry is up against?", "The Horcruxes.", "Right. Anybody get killed in this one?", "Dobby.", "Oh, no!"], ["Do you enjoy the Harry Potter movies?", "Yes there are great,  you?", "Yes they are the best wizard movies", "I love how they include other things too", "Like what?", "Like ghosts, and giants, and elves", "Oh yea,  that is pretty cool", "It is", "They are great family movies", "Yes they are"], ["I just finished watching Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix!", "Oh wow! Isn't it great? What did you think?", "I think it's interesting how much darker all of the movies keep getting as they progress through the series.", "Same. I get so sad whenever I watch that movie and Sirius dies.", "I know. It's so sad to see Harry losing the only real family member he's ever known.", "That's true. The only good thing is that he has so many people who care about him that he'll always have a surrogate family in a sense.", "I just have a feeling that the rest of the movie are going to get so dark that he'll probably keep losing people he loves.", "Yeah, I'm not sure. What was your favorite part of the whole movie?", "I liked the scene when they're in the Ministry of Magic and they're trying to save the Prophecy.", "I also like when Professor Trelawney gives them divination readings.

By 2017 you haven't seen ANY of the movies?", "No. I've read the books so many times I'm worried it will ruin it.", "Only if you go into the movies expecting the same thing as the books, word for word, scene for scene.", "Does that not happen?", "Well, in the first book they almost match it up scene for scene, but they cut out some of the stuff at the end when they are trying to get to the stone.", "Really? That sucks. I love that part of the book.", "Yeah, but there is SO much they get right. And some much that the books don't have.", "Really? Like what.", "The music. Right off the bat, it adds so much to it. Plus the detail that they put into all of the shots. My visit of Hogwarts couldn't compare to the movie version."], ["Whats your favorite movie series?", "Harry Potter hands down.", "Really?  I've seen the first one a really long time ago but I never finished it.", "You have to!  I know there are a lot of them but everything about them is great.", "How many movies are there?", "Well, there's eight Harry Potter movies but that new movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them takes place in the same universe.  It happens before Harry Potter.", "So should I start with the first Harry Potter or that new movie?", "You should definitely start with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  The new one just has nods to the others that you wouldn't get if you hadn't watched them first.", "Does it have any of the same actors?", "No, not that I know of.  Speaking of that the casting is amazing.  Daniel Radcliffe was spot on playing Harry Potter."], ["Did it ever bother you how whiny Harry is in the fifth book?", "Yes, immensely.", "He is a teenager, though, and puberty does have that effect.", "He spends the whole book complaining and trying to thwart the rules.", "If Dumbledore had explained to him, he probably would have understood.", "Can a teenager really understand reason?", "If anyone could, it would be Harry.", "I don't think Sirius helped, though.", "He wasn't a very good example, and I think he paid for it with his life.", "That was brutal, but an apt metaphor for the horrible things that happen to people for no good reason."], ["Did you like Harry Potter the character in the movies?", "Yes I think he is a very interesting character.", "I like him because he's been through so much and so have I plus he never gives up on a task or a person.", "No he doesn't he always persevere's to the end no matter the obstacles.", "Wasn't his parents killed when he was a baby?", "Yes they were protecting him from Voldemort.", "That's right, not sure how I forgot about that.", "I'm not sure either it's a big part of the story.", "I love how he manages to always or most of the time come out of top no matter the circumstances.", "Yep he's pretty clutch you could say."], ["Hey.", "Hi.", "Do you like Harry Potter?", "Yeah sure.", "Me too.", "Do you have a character that you hate?", "Interesting question.", "Take your time.", "I hated that principal type female character.", "Umbridge, yeah she was easy to hate."], ["I think the last two harry potter movies were the worst", "I think they were set up the best", "No way", "Why though", "because they were to drawn out", "But it covered most of the books", "But it also was bloated", "Thats the story though", "I guess the story itself is bloated", "Nah not at all"], ["What's your favorite Harry Potter movie?", "I really like The Deathly Hallows, part one.

And Harry was so sad when he was trying to find something in Hermione's purse to save Dobby with.", "Which Harry Potter movie is your favorite?", "I loved the Chamber of Secrets.", "Really? I think that's one of the worst ones! The change in direction was not a good move.", "I just liked that we're introduced to horcruxes for the first time, even if we don't know exactly what their purpose is yet.", "That's true. Plus, we get to learn more about Ginny, even though she's one of my least favorite characters."], ["I love when I get a chance to rewatch the Harry Potter movies. Any of them really, but especially when I end up having a Harry Potter marathon and can watch several of them back to back.", "Yeah, it's still hard to believe there won't be another one coming out. I got so used to there always being a new Harry Potter to see.", "What's your favorite character from the movies?", "I love Hagrid and McGonagall. Robbie Coltrane is the perfect Hagrid and I've love Dame Maggie Smith since I watched Peter Pan as a kid.", "Same here! I wish McGonagall had as big of a part in the movies as she did in the books because I definitely wanted to see more of Maggie Smith in each movie.", "I even fell for some of the actors that played awful characters too; like Helena Bonham Carter playing Bellatrix, I don't know who else could have pulled that role off so perfectly.", "Oh yeah, she was fantastic as Bellatrix. Same with Timothy Spall as Wormtail; I loathe the character but he did such an amazing job with it.", "I felt the same way about Alan Rickman, I think he got better and better as Snape with each movie.", "I did like Rickman and I couldn't imagine anyone else in the part. I didn't really love Snape's storyline, though.", "Yeah, I think he's one of those love it or hate it characters. A lot of people jumped into loving him because he died and how he died but I think that kind of misses the whole point of his character."], ["I really loved the Harry Potter movies, but I wish we could've learned more about some of the characters. They're fascinating.", "Like who?", "Lily, for one. We know she was Snape's friend, James's wife, and Harry's mother, but we never get to know her as an individual.", "Well, she was obviously kind and willing to do anything for the people she loved.", "I know, but it feels like we learned a lot more about James than we did about her.", "Yeah, I guess she was a pretty important character, wasn't she?", "Her sacrifice basically saved the Wizarding world, so yeah.", "She does deserve a lot of credit for that.", "I agree. I've always seen her and Snape as the two biggest saviors, perhaps even more than Harry himself.", "I can see that."], ["I watched Goblet of Fire again the other day!", "Oh? Was it on television?", "No, I found the DVD and decided to give it another go. You know, I never realized that Cedric was played by Rob Pattinson!", "No? I really prefer him as Cedric; seeing him in Twilight really kind of ruined it for me!", "I hear you. But I'll tell you, Amos' reaction after Cedric's death gets me every time. It's the most realistic reaction I've ever seen.", "It makes me sad every time I watch it, too.", "But I love the ball storyline. Seeing Ron get all thrown off by Hermione's transformation is still hilarious.", "I do wish they'd done some things a little more like that book, though. I thought some parts needed a little more reaction or emotion.", "Agreed. And I missed the scene from the book where Hermione teaches Krum how to say her name.", "I know. It's perfect. Hermmy-o-ninny! I still laugh!"], ["Hey friend! Do you think the Harry Potter movies are as good as the books?", "At times, sure. My favorite movie was the fourth one, because of the Tri-Wizard Tournament and the visiting wizarding schools.", "I enjoyed that one, too! If you could go to one of the schools, which would you pick?", "I'd probably choose Durmstrang. It seems a little darker than the others, a little like wizarding school in Russia.", "Plus the name is a smart pun on the \"sturm und drang\" music and literary aesthetic. Which school uniforms were your favorite in the films?", "I enjoyed the Beauxbatons blue uniforms, but it's hard to go wrong with the classic Hogwarts robes with house crests.", "What did you think about the last book being split into two movies?", "I partly thought it was a little opportunistic, but for me the last movies were the most emotionally intense because I never finished the book so all the action was actually a surprise.", "Wow, you really never finished the book? So what was the most emotional part of the final films?", "I think it had already been spoiled, but Dobby's death was definitely the toughest part."], ["Why does Ron's whole family have red hair.", "Uh... because his parents do?", "I guess is what I'm saying is you would think at least one of them wouldn't.", "Well, the whole point is that the Weasleys are known as the red-headed family.", "I guess that's why they're recognized everywhere.", "Absolutely.", "You think they ever thought of dying it?", "Why would they do that?  Just to blend in more?", "Exactly.", "Nah, their hair makes them who they are.  They like the attention."], ["I watched the last two Harry Potter movies this past weekend.", "What did you think?", "They were pretty good. I wish I had seen them when they came out in theaters.", "Yeah, it is more exciting to see the action taking place on the big screen.", "There were many scenes that had me holding my breath.", "Oh, right. I forgot you did not read the books. Which scenes are you talking about?", "For example, the scene where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were running away from the Death Eaters in the woods.", "Oh yeah, and how about the scene when they visited Godric's Hollow and the old lady turned out to be the snake? That was scary.", "But I thought the battle scene could have been more epic.", "Really? I thought it was well done."], ["Are thier any good thiller moviers out now", "Over the weekend i watch harry potter", "Yeah man she's good", "It had on the edge of my seat", "Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food", "It wasn't funny at all just creepy", "It was really scary", "And creepily", "On Saturday i will see something funny", "But this movie was not bad"], ["Which was your favorite Harry Potter film?", "My favorite was the original, Sorceror's Stone.", "I liked that for the most part it kept to the story line.", "Sure it helped that it was the shortest book so that made it easier.", "Yes, they didn't need to cut out too many parts.", "That was one thing that bugged me about some of the other films, especially Deathly Hollows.", "That film while it was long, did miss a lot of what was in the book.", "That is one thing I cannot stand. I can't believe sometimes that authors would go along with scripts sometimes.", "Yes you would think that Rowling would have objected to some changes.", "Maybe yes and maybe no. She sure got enough money for it though."], ["Did you like Deathly Hollows part one or two better, in the Harry Potter franchise?", "Part two, for sure.", "Why is that?", "The music was haunting and the scenes were quite somber, with the dementors surrounding Hogwarts and Snape silently watching the students in their marching formation", "It really set a tone for the whole movie.", "It showed the state of the Wizarding world at the time.", "So desperate, that kids were the first and last line of defense.", "I think it was a really good abstract of coming of age.", "For more than just Harry too.", "Right. For the whole magic world, the coming to terms with the fact they were not as capable as they thought."], ["Fick and Swish!", "What are you doing?", "Practicing my magic.", "Potter nerd!", "There having a marathon down at the theater.", "Really?", "Yup, wanna come.", "Have to take a pass.", "I thought you liked those movies.", "Just not as much as you."], ["Hey, you read the books, right?", "Yeah, why?", "Did Harry break the Elder Wand in the books?", "No, he just re-buried it with Dumbledore where anyone could get at it. One of the few film changes I actually liked, though they could've handled it better.", "How so?", "Well in the book, Harry repaired his wand first, remember when Hermione broke it in Hallows Part 1?", "But what about the wand he was using during the final battle?", "It was Draco's, and the movie implies he never gave it back.", "Well there was a nineteen-year time skip, anything could've happened.", "I guess, I just like the more definitive way the book spelled it out."], ["What do you think is the best part of the Harry Potter series?", "I don't know if I could pick! But one of my favorite things is how much Snape loves Lily. It makes me so sad at the same time though.", "Why do you think that?", "His love for Lily really dictates how he acts throughout the entire series. Ultimately, all of his actions are to protect Harry because he's the last piece of her that he can ever hold onto.", "He does a really good job of hiding that love, though. I just think of when Snape is trying to teach Harry Occlumency and he's being so mean when he goes into his memories.", "Yeah, he was being mean. But Harry is mean too. He gets into Snape's mind and sees some of his earliest memories as well.", "I think that Snape really wanted Harry to see some of his earlier memories, especially when he was dying. He pulled them out of his brain in his last minutes and Harry watched them in the Pensieve.", "I think that's one of the defining moments of Snape's character for me. You really get to see what was going on in his brain the entire time.", "I think one of the biggest turning points for me is when Dumbledore gets killed.", "I think so too. You can tell that he knew he was going to get killed, but he had planned everything out so that it would be okay even after his death."], ["So now that you have finished the entire series, what is your final Snape opinion?", "Oh wow, I don't even know yet. I am still processing. I think I have always felt like Snape wasn't evil.", "Even at the end of Half-Blood Prince?", "Yes, I had a feeling more was going on. Good old Rowling!", "Yeah, I had my doubts though. I still don't think he is all good. I mean, he still did really bad things.", "I agree. And the reason he was good-ish at the end was because he was obsessed with a dead woman who didn't even love him!", "Exactly! But man, I was crying with the whole Snape flashback.", "Alan Rickman was absolutely amazing at that part. That was incredibly emotional.", "He really was. And people say that's a kid's movie!", "Right! It so isn't! Snape redeemed himself."], ["Which of the Harry Potter movies is your favorite?", "That's a hard decision. For the earlier movies, I like \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" best.", "Me too. How about the later ones?", "Well, I like the second installment of \"Deathly Hallows\" best. It was great to see Voldemort destroyed.", "I like that one, but I was sad to lose so many of my favorite characters.", "I can understand that. Which of the later movies is your favorite then?", "Definitely \"Half-Blood Prince\". That's where everything started coming together, and Snape was excellent.", "You do love Snape, don't you?", "Yes, he's definitely my favorite character.", "Obviously."], ["Do you remember the firework scene in Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix?", "Yes I do, why?", "I was just thinking about fireworks and the part where Fred and George came to mind.", "That's such a good part.", "Yeah it is especially when they started shooting fireworks everywhere and made Ron, Harry and Hermoine laugh.", "Weren't some people scared too?", "Yes, Draco, Crabbe and Umbridge I think.", "That's right I remember her running in terror.", "Yeah that was a funny part, they're just fireworks.", "I know right."]]}
