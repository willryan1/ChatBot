It wasn't until 1850s in New York, that they tried to standardize the ball weight, size, etc. But it wasn't until 1876 that AG Spalding convinced the the National league to adopt his balls.", "Spalding as in the sporting equipment guy?", "Yep. he was a picther and pretty good one at that, and he happened to make his own balls, and thought that his was better than others, and the NL agreed, and the ball remained for the next century.", "What happened n 1976?", "The MLB decided to go with Rawlings, and that's why we have Rawlings logo on the balls and that's why."], ["Did you catch the game between the O's  and the blue jays", "Yeah!", "It was a great game.", "Yeah the O's  had that walk off homer at the bottom of the 10th", "Yeah I totally thought they'd give that game up.", "Well, they have been on a bit of a losing streak lately.", "Their pitching needs some improvemeny.", "I agree.

It was really sad.", "Sure for quite some time there were so many players that suddenly came to camp looking like the Incredible Hulk.  It was in all of the sports to some extent.  You can't really blame the athletes too much as they all wanted to achieve stardom, do it better and faster, be stronger to dominate", "Yes, and many looked the other way as the hulks were drawing crowds with their exploits.

He didn't make the majors until his late 20's from his war service and was best known as a n awesome relief pitcher.", "I think he hit a home run in his first big league at bat and had a screwball that was almost impossible to hit.  I don't know how many saves he had but i think he played until he was almost 50.", "Now the pitchers usually only pitch for a few innings and are pulled for specialists like mid inning relievers and closers.  They usually only allow them to throw a certain number of pitches then pull them out to not strain them.", "Well, I think the greatest of all time was Babe Ruth as he was a great pitcher who turned outfielder so he could play and hit every day.
