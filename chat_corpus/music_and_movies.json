It's the latest Christopher Nolan movie.", "I heard that was good, but that it had some absurd science in it.", "I really liked it. But yeah, there were some major implausibilities in it.", "Like what?", "Worst was the \"going into a black hole and surviving\" thing.", "Ugh. I had that. But was it worth it?", "I think so. I mean, there's are symbolic ways to interpret the absurd science in this case.", "How do you mean?", "Like, love was seen as a fundamental force in the universe, like gravity. Scientifically absurd, but beautiful on a symbolic level, and emotionally resonant.", "I guess. I have a hard time with movies that have implausibility. Wasn't Matt Damon in that movie? He's one of my favorites.", "Yeah, Damon played a minor character. A real jerk, did not behave very well to say the least!", "How were the female characters in the movie?", "There were some strong, smart women in the movie. Well, mostly the main character's daughter. But she was really good.", "I wish there were more good female characters in movies.", "Agreed. Pretty rare for a movie to have multiple richly-drawn female characters these days.", "Especially science fiction movies!"], ["What are you up to.", "Just gonna do a little shopping.", "Boring!", "True.

But, since you brought it up, how about an example?", "So the trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy uses that \"Fox on the Run\" song by Sweet.", "Yep, I really have fond thoughts about that song. It really brings me back to when I was 7. Let's sing it....", "Let's not. So the song is playing in the scene when the Dumpster Panda is trying to get Baby Groot not to push the wrong button.", "So what?", "Well, it just doesn't make any sense. First of all, Dumpster Panda is some sort of demented raccoon and not a fox. And it's not running from anything noway.", "The tree thing was running.", "Well, maybe the song should be dubbed to \"Baby Groot Be Runnin.\"", "You're an idiot. The song has nothing to do with a fox. It's kind of about a girl who is past her prime, not that I'd ever say any woman was passed her prime because women only get better as they age, or so I think.", "Oh, of course. I agree completely. Sweet existed during a time when it was proper to make sexist and lewd comments at the expense of women. I'm glad those times are over, even if it meant the death of rock & roll.", "So we are agreed? Women are ok in our book. I mean, after all, our mothers are women. And frankly, so are our sisters. I don't want to insult them. And most of the women on the planet are women as well.", "Absolutely.", "So what was the point of all this?", "I kind of lost track, but I think it was that the movie soundtracks are arbitrary and the songs are only used to generate additional sales. And probably most of them are already in the public domain so they don't cost the producers nothin' to use.", "Right. So someone picked up the rights to the Sweet song for cheap.", "Exactly. And women are cool."], ["Hi, guy.", "Hi, What's up?", "I wondered if you've ever heard of Deanna Durbin?", "No, who's that?", "She was this amazingly popular singer and actress from the forties that nobody has ever heard of today.", "Huh!

But then the dad gets well, oops.", "I know Bob Cummings. He can be funny.", "Yeah, he's really caught in the middle here. He set up the impersonation to give his dad a happy last moment, but then what does he do?", "Anyway, so what about this Durbin woman?", "Well, she wants to get out of the situation, but comes to like the father and doesn't want to disillusion him.", "That sounds pretty trite.", "You'd think so, but the thing about Deanna Durbin is that she makes it all seem really fresh.", "You seem to have really developed a crush on her!", "Yeah, well, maybe. It's just so odd to me that she could have been such a big name and be almost unremembered now.", "I guess. Under the old studio system, the actors were a lot more like commodities. Even big stars sometimes had to do two or three movies in a year.", "It's true, I guess there were probably a lot of actors that everybody recognized then but we don't know now.", "I read somewhere that they almost cast Ronald Reagan as Rick in \"Casablanca.\"", "Naw, that's a myth.

It's one of my favorite movie trilogies.", "It was so far ahead of its time.  What was your favorite?", "I loved the first one since it introduced us to the world of Middle-Earth.  It also had the best balance of all the elements; adventure, action, drama.", "I really liked the first one; especially the Cave troll scene.  That said, I am a big fan of the action of 'Two Towers.'", "Helm's Deep was such a great scene.  Theoden's speech was an instant classic.", "It gives me chills every time.  'Lord of the Rings' is also one of the few movie franchises that stay true to the original source material.", "Yea, they did justice to Tolkien's works.", "True masterpieces.", "Well, we should start soon if we want to get all the way through to 'Return of the King.'

It blew me away.", "The movie or the music?", "Both really.", "Was the movie that great?", "It was a true story, but really had this huge sense of purpose you know.", "And the music?", "The music was the perfect companion. It really helped you feel as if you were on the adventure.", "That is what music should do for movies. Evoke something.", "Emotion, elation. Whatever the director wants us to feel.", "I think that is why music is important.", "I really enjoyed a few films even more, due to their music.", "Like?", "Nick and Nora's infinite play list.", "Is that not just about the music.", "No, but the music really makes the movie worth while."], ["When I lived in Detroit I used to be able to see a band any night of the week.

Also other Jack White side projects, also.", "Did you like their music?", "Oh forsure. Many people did. Although, when they became famous many people became bitter.", "How so?", "Well, people who had helped Jack felt that they owned a piece of his success. They felt they were owed something.", "What did they feel they were owed?", "I don't know. Many of these guys were musicians who had helped produce or record his first album. They wanted more recognition, fame, and money.", "Do you think they were jealous?", "Somewhat. Many of these guys were in absolutely fantastic bands that never received the kind of attention the White Stripes did. Maybe they felt they deserved it more. It was a strange time.", "Is Jack White a nice guy?", "He was always nice to me. Kind of quiet, but sweet.

A lot of people feel that the sequel didn't handle that as well.", "Do you feel this sway?", "No, I find it pretty obvious that since the first film dealt so heavly with this part, then they wanted to move on rather quickly.

I haven't listened to their music in a while.", "Yep, they're still going strong. In fact, the lead singer, Justin Hayward, and the bass player, John Lodge, each did solo shows earlier this year and I got to see them both!", "Wow, that's great! How were the shows?", "Well Justin's was acoustic and pretty laid back, but it was good. John's was more electric and energetic. I loved both shows, but my husband enjoyed John's the best.", "And now the Moody Blues will be touring this summer?", "Yes, mostly the West Coast. It's the 50th anniversary of their first album, Days of Future Passed. They'll be performing every track from that album, and even playing with a symphony orchestra in some cities.", "Wow, that sounds amazing.", "I'm sure it will be.

How much are tickets?", "They're not cheap, I think they start at around a hundred dollars. And that's just a part of it. We'd probably want to fly, so there's the air fare, and then of course a hotel room for a couple of days, and meals.", "Yeah, I hadn't thought about that. Do you think you can come up with the money somehow?", "I'm wishful thinking. But realistically I don't see how we can pull this off, even if went alone.", "Why would you want to go alone?", "Well, my husband isn't as into the Moody Blues as I am, so he wouldn't really care if he didn't go. And I know other fans on the West Coast that I would be able to hang out, so I wouldn't really be by myself.", "Gee, I hope you can figure out a way to get there!
