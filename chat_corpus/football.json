He'd love that!", "That's a good idea. He has all kinds of Cowboys memorabilia.", "Like what?", "A steering wheel cover and floor mats for his truck, shirts, and even a seat from the old stadium that his Dad bought him for his Birthday.", "What in the world does he do with that?", "Honestly it is just sitting in his closet collecting dust.", "What a silly waste of money!", "No, it means a lot to him that his Dad thought to buy him something he would like. They aren't close but he wishes they were.", "Well I guess that is nice then, but I wouldn't want that old thing in my house!"], ["Hey, man, did you catch the NFL draft?", "Yeah, I caught parts of it, they had some interesting picks here and there.", "Oh, anyone in particular you thought was a good choice?", "Well, again, only caught part of it, but I think  Solomon Thomas for the 49ers might be a good choice.", "Yeah, could be, he seems pretty versatile Only thing I find odd about him as pick is they already got decent defense men.", "Well, you can never have too many defensemen as long as you're not neglecting the other areas you'll need.", "Yeah, that's true.", "What about you?  What picks did you find interesting?", "I thought Joe Williams was a good pick, myself.", "Oh, missed that part.. where did he get picked up from?", "Utah.  He's got a pretty record with speed he's got like 1,407 yards on 210 carries.", "Oh, not bad!  That'll be good for dodging tackles and whatnot.", "Yeah, that's what i was thinking.  Did you remember any other picks you got?", "Well, not sure about \"good\" but definitely notable...  Reuben Foster.", "I think I heard about him.. did he fail a drug test?", "Yeah, that's what I meant about concerns, but lot of his teammates support his character so, the result could have been a false positive.", "Well, it's not like there no drugs in the NFL... I mean, if you took out everyone I bet half the teams would have to stay home.", "Yeah, that's true, but from what I understand, the guy was really sought after, even got a A+ rating from Niner's wire online.", "Wow, they're awfully pick about who they get anything above a \"B\" to.", "So I've been told."], ["How do you feel about the Raiders moving to Las Vegas?", "I think it's really disappointing.", "Yeah, you have been a Raider fan ever since they moved back to Oakland", "I feel like the ownership really didn't make any effort to stay in Oakland and I think its a crummy way to treat such a loyal fanbase", "Well, they paid good money to Carr to keep him for the future.", "Yeah, I think he's great and hopefully we can make the most of the remaining time they have in Oakland", "How do you feel about the acquisition of Marshawn Lynch?", "Beastmode! I think it's aweosme.", "Yeah, that was a great move for your team", "I thought it was so cool that he said he would only to come play for us.", "I always respect a player who wants to come back to his hometown and show some love to the hometown fans", "Its cuz the Raiders have the best fans in the league!", "Some people would beg to differ.", "That's just because they haven't been to a game.  The fans are really loyal, but we're also really cool.", "What about the Black Hole?", "Yeah, we're the only team without a mascot.  The fans are the mascot for the Raiders.  The Black Hole is amazing.  People only think they're scary.", "Do you think you'll stay a fan after the move?", "I can't really see that happening.  I feel like the only people that will attend the Vegas games are fans of the visiting teams who also wanted a vacation, and guests of corporate bigwigs.", "Yeah, I think Vegas will kinda suck the soul out of the team and the fanbase.", "At least my Sundays will be a lot more free in the fall!"], ["What do you think of the Seahawks chances?", "I dunno, seems like they can't get over the hump.", "Maybe, I think they have a strong year though.", "How many games do you think they win?", "I'm guessing 12.", "I think they win 10.", "Russell Wilson makes them competitive.", "Yea, with him in the game, they always have a chance.", "They sure spanked the Lions in the playoffs last year.", "That was a beating.", "I hope their defense is improved.", "It had better be.", "I miss the Hawks being in the AFC.", "Yea, it still seems funny with them in the NFC.", "I miss the rivalries with San Diego, Denver, etc.", "Those were great times.", "Steve Largent was an awesome receiver.", "Is he in the Hall of Fame?", "If not he should be.", "I couldn't agree more."], ["Hey there.  You excited about the upcoming season?  What's your team?", "You betcha I am.  Packers all the way!  I can't wait....", "Actually, I was talking to that gentleman over there.

How's the weather been around your place?", "It's great weather for a game.  I can't wait for the Green and Gold to beat down the opposition this year and bring the trophy back to Title Town where it should really permanently sit.", "I see you've brought it back to the Packers.  So you are confident this year?", "Of course.  Nelson is the best receiver in the league; Rodgers is the best QB; the defense will be much better because we have more inexperienced rookies in the secondary; and we have a brand new running back that hasn't yet been physically broken down by a full season of games.", "And the best always rise to the top, don't they?", "Heck yes.  That's why they always make the playoffs.", "But don't necessarily win.  Did they rise to the top against the Falcons last year?", "That was only because of the bad call against the fullback when he supposedly fumbled!", "What about that Seahawk game?  Did they rise to the top when they were up by 9 with 4 minutes left?", "That's not fair!  They were ripped off.  There were so many penalties that weren't called!", "Didn't they lead the league in scoring in 2011 but got stuffed by the Giants?  And if I recall, the refs were looking for ways to get the Packers back into the game.", "The Giants stole all of our signals!  They cheated.", "Nope, that was the Giants vs. Vikings.  Nice try though.  What about when Favre threw that late interception to the Giants?", "I don't talk about him.  He's a traitor.", "So you still think that they're destined to win?", "After they've been hosed so many times, how can I not?"], ["Let's talk about the NFL.", "Sounds good to me.", "What is your favorite team?", "The Patroits.", "Mine too!", "Do you have a favorite player?", "No, actually I don't.", "That is rather interesting.", "Brady is decent though.", "I agree, no one is like him.", "Have you been to any games recently?", "No I have not.", "That is too bad.", "Yeah but hopefully next year I can go.", "Have you watched all of the games?", "Yeah.", "Were you happy with the SuperBowl win?", "Totally!", "Well it was great talking to you!", "Same."], ["Do you think the Broncos will be able to compete again this year?", "I think they will be good, that defense is top notch.", "Yeah but who is gonna start for them", "I would assume Trevor Siemian again", "What about paxton lynch?", "I dont think he is their future QB. Too many questions.", "They took him in the first round!", "Better to admit a mistake before it gets bad.", "I think Chad Kelly might end up the starter at the end of the year", "He didnt show me enough in college.", "He was pretty good", "Yeah but nothing he specifically did translates to the NFL", "I dont know about that, he had a good run.", "Well back to Denver, if their defense sucks then they might be in trouble.", "I just think they really regress this year.", "Will Elway ever come down and coach?", "I think he likes being an executive more than that.", "Yeah me too.", "They should be able to compete but that division belongs to Oakland.", "Never count out Denver though"], ["Hey do you watch football?", "Oh yes, I love Manchester United.", "No, I mean American football, not soccer.", "Oh, well we call our game \"football\" in England, not \"soccer.\"", "Well do you want me to explain American football to you?", "Okay, go ahead.", "Well, despite the name \"football\" only the punter and kicker really kick the ball.", "Whats the difference between the punter and the kicker?", "Well the kicker kicks field goals and the punter punts the ball to the other team.", "What is a field goal?", "When a team kicks the ball through the big yellow uprights they get three points.", "I see. Why does the punter punt the ball to the other team?", "Well if the team with the ball doesn't advance it 10 yards in 3 tries they can either punt it to the other team or try again to get the needed yardage.", "So why don't they try again every time instead of punting?", "If they don't make it on the fourth try the other team gets better field position.", "What's field position?", "That is a measure of how close a team is to the end zone.", "What is the end zone?", "That's the other way to score, if you bring the ball to the end zone it's a touchdown worth 6 points.", "That seems a lot more complicated than our football!"], ["Who do you think is going to win the NFC South this season?", "That's a good question. I think that Jameis Winston will have a breakout season and lead the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to first in the division.", "Do you think it's likely that for the third time in three years, the NFC South will have an average quarterback come out of nowhere and dominate the league?", "When you put it like that, it sounds unlikely. However, he has an elite receiving core with the addition of DeSean Jackson.", "Jackson is an excellent deep threat and I predict that he will complement Mike Evans. However, the defense worries me.", "What about Gerald McCoy? He's coming off his fifth Pro Bowl season.", "True, although their defensive secondary leaves much to be desired.", "It's probably their weakest element, but I'm still optimistic. Who do you think will win the NFC South this season?", "I'd have to predict the Carolina Panthers.", "Really? They had an awful 6-10 record last season.", "Yeah, but I think that Cam Newton will bounce back. Furthermore, I'm very excited to see how they use Christian McCaffrey.", "He should be an excellent player on offense. However, I'm worried that Cam Newton's propensity to run the ball will open him up to injury, which could hurt their overall offense.", "I think that they drafted McCaffrey to put Cam Newton in better positions so that he won't run the ball as much.", "Maybe, although Cam Newton is the type of player that does front flips into the end zone. I think that he will continue to put himself at risk for injury.", "Newton's size definitely contributes to his fearlessness while playing. However, I feel that the combination of Christian McCaffrey, Greg Olsen, and a healthy Kelvin Benjamin will allow him to distribute the ball more.", "We'll see. However, their defense is probably worse situated than Tampa Bay.", "I disagree. Luke Kuechly is still one of the best linebackers in the league and they have many underrated players like Shaq Thompson.", "But their secondary has never fully recovered since Josh Norman left for the Washington Redskins. Furthermore, their defensive coordinator just departed to become the head coach of the Buffalo Bills.", "True. However, Ron Rivera is a former defensive coordinator himself, so I'm not overly concerned regarding a huge drop off in terms of defense.", "We'll see. It's funny though that neither of us picked the defending NFC Champion Atlanta Falcons."], ["Hey there, are you going to watch any NFL games this season?", "Yeah, I'll probably tune into a few.", "Oh, cool man. What's your favorite team?", "I like the Falcons.", "Oh yeah? Are you from the Atlanta area?", "Yeah I grew up there, but now I live in Detroit.", "Oh, so do you like the Lions too? They had a decent season last year.", "Yeah I root for them too, I like Matt Stafford.", "Yeah he's a pretty good quarterback. Who are some of your other favorite players?", "I like Matt Ryan, and Julio Jones. What about you?", "Yeah I like those guys too. But my favorite player is probably Marshawn Lynch.", "Beast Mode. Yeah you must be excited that he came out of retirement to play this season.", "Oh for sure man. It will be weird seeing him playing for the Raiders though.", "Yeah, that's his hometown though right? Oakland?", "Yeah I think that's why he came out of retirement, to play for his home team.", "Oh, thats cool, we will see how the Raiders do this year.", "I don't know if they will do that well. They are in a tough division.", "Yeah the Chiefs, and Broncos and who else are in that division?", "The Chargers.", "Oh yeah that's right. They didn't do too well last year."], ["Hey man, do you follow football?", "Yeah, I'm a Patriots fan.", "Lucky you, still enjoying the trophy?", "Yeah right, that game was really crazy.", "I hate the Patriots but even I have to admit that was insane.", "Yeah man, I will never forget that win.", "What do you think this year?", "About the Patriots? They will probably go deep into the playoffs but I don't know about the Superbowl this year.", "Why not?", "I just think Brady is getting a little old, and he can still play well but I don't know about another Superbowl.", "They are the best team in the league right now aren't they?", "All-around, coaching included, probably yes, but the Falcons are going to be hot with revenge, man.", "True that Atlanta coach is probably still fuming.", "Plotting ways of revenge.", "Hahaha, anyway, I think if the Patriots aren't the best team in the league the Seahawks are because of defense.", "The Patriots have a nasty defense though too.", "Yeah but they are all getting older and the rest of the league is figuring them out now.", "You can study Tom Brady for years and still not have him \"figured out\". Look at the last Superbowl as an example.", "Good luck this year man, try not to deflate any balls this time.", "Very funny."], ["So, how do you think the Green Bay Packers will do this year?", "They did lose Eddie Lacey, but I think the rookie will fill in his shoes nicely,  I like them to get back to the Super Bowl.", "You sound very confident about that. What makes you think so?", "I think Aaron Rodgers will want to put another ring on his finger before he calls is quits.", "Aaron Rodgers still has a lot of years left. Why do you think this is his year?", "I like the additions they've made to the offense, especially Martellus Bennett from the Patriots", "Yeah, they really need a playmaker at that position, I'm with you on that one.", "I also really like the rookie running back they picked up in the draft", "We need to have to have a good running back to make the passing game work.", "Yes!  We have so many good receivers and if we can have any success in the running game, watch out!", "What else?", "I also think Aaron Rodgers is so good.  He gets frustrated not being in the big game.  He really should have been there more than once.", "I know.  I felt bad for him the year he played injured for the whole playoffs only to be let down", "I remember it like yesterday!  Up by 15 points with less than five minutes to play in the 4th quarter.  How do you lose that game?", "Everything that could have gone wrong did.  A botched onside kick, a blown coverage 50 yards downfield.  It makes me sick!", "Me too!  Forget I brought it up.  This year we will make up for it and get back to the Super Bowl.", "I am with you.  Do you have tickets to any of the games this year?", "I can buy some from my friend who has season tickest, but they're expensive this year.  over $100 a seat I think.", "I will pitch in and we should go to at least one game this year!", "Sounds great.  I will talk to my friend and see what games I can get!  Talk to you later!"], ["What is your favorte team?", "I have two, because I can't choose like that.", "Fair enough, what are they?", "My first is the Tampa Bay Buckeneers...", "Seriously? I never hear that one.", "Yeah, it's my family's team.", "Family's team?", "You know, everyone in my family likes them so I like them by association.", "Oh okay, I guess that makes sense.", "Yeah, my other favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers.", "I like the Steelers too!", "Do you watch a lot of their games?", "Not really, I always seem to be working whenever any are on.", "Well, I just think they are a great team.", "Yeah, they've won a lot I believe.", "Games? Superbowls?", "Well, obviously both if you win games to win the Superbowl....", "Fair enough. When was the last time they won a Superbowl anyway?", "I'm pretty sure like 2 or 3 years ago.", "Yeah, something like that."], ["I heard the Chiefs are looking for a new running back.", "They should could use one and defensive end too.", "Do you think inflate-gate was something real?", "I don't like the Patriots that much but I don't think letting a little air out of the ball is going to matter.", "Do you think New England will win the Superbowl again?", "I don't know who else is going to knock them off, maybe the Cowboys.", "Are you sick of all the pink gear in the NFL?", "Nah, that's OK, I'm just sick of all the politics and the high ticket prices.", "What happened to ESPN?  The can't even talk football without some political slant.", "Yeah, I'm sick of it.  They should stick to the game.  People watch the NFL to get away from politics.", "Do think the Browns will ever win the Superbowl.", "Yep, as soon as pigs fly and hell freezes over.", "I think the Chiefs are going to be better this year.  They haven't lost anyone major.", "They should.  They finished strong but they still have an anemic offense.", "It's not fair.

His speed and catching range are not just the best in the NFL right now, but potentially all time great.", "I agree that he is among the best receivers, if not the best receiver, in terms of talent. However, he's too temperamental, especially in his match ups against Josh Norman.", "I believe that in his last match up against Josh Norman, Norman was the one with all the penalties and getting overly emotional.", "True, but this is following too match ups where Norman obviously got the better of Beckham Jr. Furthermore, the boat trip before the Green Bay playoff game last year demonstrated poor decision making on his part and hurt his team.", "The criticism surrounding that boat trip is ridiculous.

But, I mean he still produces pretty well, and the Steelers do have some younger talent that is pretty impressive.", "Oh, no, you're right about that.

Their defensive ends were missing in action last year.", "Yeah, I don't know what happened with Ziggy Ansah but he was a disappointment last year.", "The secondary has improved over the last couple years but never can get the job done against the best quarterbacks like Tom Brady.", "That's why the pass rush is so important because it helps the defensive backs when the quarterback is under pressure.", "Well if they can pull all the elements together they have a good shot at the playoffs with the schedule they have.", "And once you're in the playoffs you're only a few wins away from the Super Bowl, which would be a first for the Lions."], ["Have you looked at any of the NFL schedulet yet?", "No I have not.

Another second year player.", "He was a nice surprise, but I think Elliot is the clearly superior talent.", "Jordan Howard had nothing going for him, though.

Chicago is a disaster and Minnesota will be worse without Adrian Peterson.", "The NFC East could get three playoff spots.", "Yeah, it could.

I want an autographed football helmet they have listed online in the official NFL shop that's signed by Tom Brady.", "That sounds like a great present for you! What's the problem?", "My wife refuses to buy it. She said it is way too much money for something that sits on a shelf.", "Uh oh, how much is it?", "Fifteen hundred dollars. But it's authentic. It's hand signed by Brady, and has a certificate from the NFL that it's authentic.", "Would it lose value later if someone suspected it wasn't authentic?", "It has a special hologram with a number that will show if it's tampered with. This helps guarantee it's the real deal.", "Did you try telling your wife it could actually increase in value after Brady retires?", "I tried to tell her it was an investment and could always be sold later, but she thinks the value will go down.", "Generally that might be true, but when you're talking about one of the great, well known players like Brady, the value should at least hold even.", "It's a Super Bowl Champions helmet, signed by a five time Super Bowl Champion, so I'm sure it would still retain its value.", "Well, the only thing you can do is just keep mentioning over and over how you bought her the ring she wanted, but if she isn't going to reciprocate, then in the future you will just get her small sensible gifts, and that will scare her into getting you that helmet."], ["What caused changes in Todd Gurley's play between 2015 and 2016?", "Todd Gurleys 2016 stats pale in comparison to what he did in his rookie season.", "I've heard rams fans claim this was either because opposing defenses stacked the box in the face of an anemic rams passing attack, or because gurley's actual play got worse.", "RT Rob Havenstein regressed due to an ankle injury. Center Tim Barnes went from inconsistent to just bad. We lost Garrett Reynolds who was actually a really good run blocker. Jamon Brown/Cody Wichmann/Andrew Donnal all were poor guards. It got worse for sure.", "And also, it did suck in 2015 too. Aside from Gurley's hot start in his first 4 or so, he really didn't do a whole ton the rest of that year either.

He turned our OL into what it is right now.", "he wasn't much of a coordinator but gave the bears the best O line they've had in my lifetime.", "That's gotta be the oddest collection of aging vets and young talent. Did they draft any depth to develop at C or OT?", "They felt confident in the OL we drafted in 2015, so I'm guessing Kromer thinks he can mold them.

With Carr and Lynch, they are going to be interesting to watch.", "There is definitely a lot of potential there.", "I saw an interview with Carr after it was announced that he would get the largest contract in history, and he talked about tithing and living the same way. I thought that was really cool.", "Wow, that is different. I hope he succeeds.", "Me too. I think their team will go through alot of growth this year and in the years to come."], ["Did you hear about Drew Brees", "no, what happened", "he broke his leg", "WHAT?!", "I'm not joking, he feel at his house, and broke his leg", "This is going to kill our season!!!!!", "It doesn't look good", "What did he do?", "They say it was a pickup game of basketball", "I don't beleve that for a second", "There is video, he lands on it wrong, it's brutal", "I don't even want to see it", "No you don't", "This is going to kill my fantasy team.", "I forgot, you always pick brees", "he is my hold from season to season", "Oh man", "I know", "I'm sorry", "This is terrible."], ["Who do you think is the worst team in the league?", "Browns. The Cleveland Browns", "The Jets are right up there with them in being awful.", "You mean being down there. There is no up with the Browns nor the Jets.", "Haha! Ain't that the truth", "The Jets have no QB, the browns have no QB.", "It is hard to judge which team is worse at this point.", "Browns have Osweiler", "They only traded for him because the Texans gave them a pick to take his contract.", "Yeah that was a dumb move by the Texans to pay him that much.", "Osweiler should of stayed with the Broncos. Everyone knew Peyton Manning was leaving.", "It was about the money and the Broncos shorted him in offers.", "I would of rather took less money then go play for the Texans.", "Well he was rewarded by being traded to one of the worst teams, if not the worst.", "I can't remember the last time the Browns were good.", "I think it was in the 1990's when the Patriots current coach was their head coach.", "Didn't the team get sold when he was the Browns coach?", "I think so, tough luck because the Ravens who the Browns became have won two superbowls", "Yeah tough luck for Browns fans. Not sure how many there really are.", "I think I knew one Browns fan, maybe."], ["Do you still like the NFL even with all the concussion issues?", "Yes, I love watching football. That hasn't changed for me.", "But don't you think it is too dangerous?", "I think those are all adult men making a decision to play, and they know the risks.", "I have a hard time watching anymore.", "I still love the game and I don't think it is different than any other sport, or even extreme sports.", "I guess that is true.", "They have implemented rules to try to make the game safer, like the helmet-to-helment and targeting rules.", "But that doesn't physically stop players from doing it.", "No, you are right, but I think there are fewer instances.", "Maybe. It is just so intense.", "That is what I like about it. I think it is so much more interesting and engaging than other sports.", "There is definitely more action than in baseball, I'll agree.", "For sure. And I've never been a huge fan of hockey or basketball. I just really love the NFL.", "What's your favorite team?", "The Patriots, but I genuinely like watching all the games.", "So you are as much a fan of the game as you are a team.", "Well, I'm definintely a Patriots fan, but I am certainly a fan of the game too.", "I just don't understand grown men running into each other over a ball.", "Well, it is a bit more complex than that! Maybe you should give it another chance."]]}
