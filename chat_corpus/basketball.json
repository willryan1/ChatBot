When is it? I haven't been to a game in forever!", "It's this Friday night against the Jazz.  I know how much you hate them.", "Oh my gosh I'd love to go, but I have a football game that night, and won't be free until 10pm.", "That sucks, I don't think you've been to Staples Center yet huh?", "No! I've been dying to go now. The last Laker game I went to was at the Forum.", "Damn that was a long time ago.  Are you serious that you haven't been to Staples Center yet?", "No, that's why I'm so mad I can't go to the game.", "That sucks, it's an amazing arena, with bars all over the place.", "How is the parking and the prices of the concessions?", "Parking is ok, but a bit expensive. They have lots of great concessions, but of course they're way overpriced.", "Well, another reason why I'd rather enjoy the Laker game at home.  Cheap beer and no lines to the restroom.", "Yeah, you're right.  So have you been able to follow the Lakers at all?", "Well, I don't watch the games on TV like I used to, and I heard that Jeannie Buss is now the only owner.", "Yeah, I know, who would've thought that she would be able to push out her brothers?", "I know.  At least she'll keep Phil close by right?", "Yeah her and Magic should be able to bring greatness back to LA", "I certainly hope so, it's been too long since we had the Championship.", "Yeah well if they make it you better go with me to the playoffs!", "Well, if you have tickets then I'll be there with all my Laker gear!"], ["Did you watch the Warriors game last night?", "Yeah they swept the Jazz.", "Who do you think will win MVP?", "Westbrook, come on, he got a triple double for the whole season.", "You think LeBron is a wimp?", "Yes, he flops like a fish and crys everytime he is fouled.", "Do you think it will be Cavs vs Warriors in the finals?", "Yeah it doesn't look like anyone can beat those two.", "Who's better Steph Curry or Kevin Durant?", "Kevin Durant by a mile.", "Do you think Paul George stays with the Pacers?", "No, I think he will be going to the Lakers.", "Will the Knicks every get good?", "Not with Phil Jackson running the team.", "Any chance Westbrook leaves the Thunder?", "No he will stay because Durant left last year.", "The Thunder could have had an amazing team.", "Yeah Durant, Westbrook, and James Harden.", "Who do you think will get the first pick in the draft?", "Probably the Knicks or Nets."], ["Have you been watching the NBA playoffs?", "Yeah, I haven't missed a game yet!  Who are you pulling for?", "I am a Celtics fan, but I've watched every game also.  Who do you pull for?", "I am pulling for the Warriors.  I hope they pull it off this year!", "They have a good chance.  Did you watch the games yesterday?", "Yes, the Celtics got crushed.  There haven't been many good games in the 2nd round.", "I know, the first round was pretty good, but this second round has been mainly blow out games.", "I think it will be the Warriors and the Cavs in the Finals.", "I agree.  It sucks that Tony Parker got injured.  That killed the Spurs chances", "I know, it was tough to see.  He is such a great player.", "Did you see the Wizard playing who got ejected vs the celtics in game 3?", "Yes!  That was crazy.  I can't believe he lost his cool like that.", "I know.  You can tell he is a young player.", "Agreed.  Who do you think wins the MVP this year?", "I really hope its Curry again, but it may be Westbrook.  He was insanely good for the Thunder.", "I hope it's Curry too, but Westbrook does have a good chance.  So many triple doubles", "I really don't want it to be LeBron James though.  I am biased because how he kills the Celtics, but i don't like him", "He will definitely be a top choice, but I think it will be Curry or Westbrook.", "Hopefully the Finals will be some good games and go to 7 like last year.", "As long as the Warriors win this time, I agree!"], ["Did you see the match between the Houston Rockets and the San Antonio Spurs last night?", "Yeah! The last 15 seconds in overtime was the best!", "They were trailing by three and put the ball in James Harden's hands thinking he was going to make the shot.", "They've been using that gameplay all year.", "But it didn't work this time. Manu Ginobili blocked him from behind.", "That was the play of the night!", "That's probably the last big moment of his career though.", "What makes you say that?", "Well, he's already 39 and he's been looking old this postseason.", "I guess your right, but I must say, crafty plays is what he's done best over his 15 year career.", "Yeah, I agree. And he finished the night with 12 points, seven rebounds, and five assists.", "True. The Spurs needed all of his performance, especially in overtime.", "You can say that again!", "Did you see what happened to Kawhi Leonard?", "No, I saw him sitting on the bench but I didn't know why.", "He hurt his ankle early in the game and never returned.", "Oh. I didn't know because I missed the first 30 minutes.", "Oh. Harden played a great game this time.", "Yeah! He recorded a triple-double with 33 points!", "Do you know when the next match is?"], ["Who do you have between the Spurs and Rockets tomorrow?", "Spurs all the way, I can't stand Houston.", "My heart says San Antonio, but my mind says Houston is going to take this series.", "What makes you say that?", "I think the Houston offense is just too much for the Spurs. It's too fast and too strong.", "Well, the Spurs did win 3 out of 4 during the regular season.", "The regular season doesn't matter anymore though, the playoffs is its own season.", "You don't think Kawhi Leonard can outplay James Harden?", "Maybe he can, but what about the rest of the team? In the last game, the Rockets were looking like they had too many weapons to stop.", "Sure, but the two games before that were all San Antonio.", "That's true, but as the series goes on, I think the Spurs get more tired. They have some old players.", "True, but I think there are enough young players that can get minutes and be effective, too.", "Only if Popovich decides to play them. He is stubborn about going with his veterans.", "That does frustrate me at times, but he has shown that he knows what he's doing.", "Anyway, I will be rooting for the Spurs, even if I don't think they'll win. I can't stand Harden.", "Me either. The NBA really needs to look into how he tries to bait the refs into calling fouls and change the rules this season.", "That would be nice, but it would be even nicer to have him embarrassed by the Spurs.", "Amen to that.", "Anyway, whatever happens in this series I still think Golden State will destroy either team in the next round.", "Unfortunately, I think you're right."], ["Did you see the Cavs/Raptors game last night?", "Yeah the Raptors are done.", "I know. They just aren't on the same level.", "Lebron is too good.", "Yep and they're too deep. Did you see that 3 Korver made?", "I did. They've got him, JR Smith, Frye...", "It's just not fair. They have the highest payroll in the league.", "They do?", "Yeah, by far. Lebron is good but they also basically just bought their team.", "I know that's kind of lame.", "Who do you think is going to win in the Celtics/Wizards series?", "I don't know. I want the Celtics to win.", "Yeah, me too. The Wizards look really good though.", "Marcin Gortat is a beast.", "John Wall is crazy good, too.", "He's so good. He can steal, rebound score.", "He's a great athlete.", "A little out of control, though, he gets a lot of turnovers.", "They sort of lack discipline.", "Yeah I guess so."], ["Alright, real talk, is Lebron James the best of all time?", "No, Michael Jordan. His Airness is the best.", "How can you say that with how lebron is dominating the east for the past 7 seasons already and counting.", "Michael Jordan was doing that in the harder east.", "Are you kidding me? Jordan had to it against one hard team and that was the Knicks.", "Are you kidding me? The Pacers were really good then.", "You're joking me. I can make the same arguement, the Pacers were really good now.", "Yes, both those two teams were very good teams that should have won a ring, but that's besides the point, Lebron plays in a weaker east.", "Well, Lebron does it all. He can pass, rebound and play defense. He also scores well.", "Yeah, but Jordan was clutch. He shot 50% at end game situations. What does Lebron do ?", "He sets his teammates up in good situations to succeed at the end of the game.", "Yeah, but Jordan grabbed the ball and did everything. Everyone in the building knew it was going to him also.", "This is just proving Lebron is more unselfish, you're taking my point and helping it succeed.", "You're not getting it. Lebron shies away from pressure.", "Jordan is a generic gambler and a terrible human being.", "So we're going to go into their personal lives? Who cares, we're talking about basketball.", "Well, it's true. Lebron is a better human being than Jordan.", "Oh please, I dont want to continue this awful conversation.", "I won. Lebron is the best.", "Whatever man, Jordan was better at basketball."], ["Have you been following the Celtics and Wizards series?", "Yeah, it's been pretty incredible so far.", "Who do you think is going win?", "I think the Celtics will take it in seven games.", "I hope they do but the Wizards have been pretty tough the past few games.", "Yeah they have. But Boston has home court advantage.", "Yeah all the games have been won by the home team this series.", "What do you think about Kelly Oubre getting suspended?", "I think he deserved it. It was a bad choice to push Olynyk like that.", "Yeah, he should have just backed off.  The pick was hard but legal.", "Do you think either team stands a chance against the Cavaliers next round?", "I don't know. I think they might win a game or two but the Cavaliers are really good.", "Yeah, The Celtics would have home court in that series, do you think that would make a difference.", "Yeah a slight one but I still think the Cavaliers would win.", "Who do you think is gonna come out of the West?", "I think the Warriors for sure.", "I think the Rockets could possibly beat the Warriors but probably not.", "Yeah. I think the Spurs are too old and too injured to keep winning in the playoffs.", "Yeah. I had them winning this series with the Rockets but now I'm not sure.", "We'll see in the next few days."], ["Who is your favorite team?", "Memphis Grizzlies, what about you?", "The suns", "Have you been to any games?", "A few", "I have been to a few Grizzlies games at home.", "Did you ever play basketball", "In high school, you?", "No, I wanted to but never did.", "That's too bad it was fun", "It looked fun, I think I was too nervous to try out.", "Who is your favorite player", "Eric Bledsoe, you?", "Marc Gasol", "Have you always liked the Grizzlies?", "Yes, what about you?", "They have always been my team", "Did they do good last season?", "Yes,  what about the Grizzlies", "They had a great season"], ["Did you see the Golden State Warriors game on Saturday?", "Yeah, they are looking tough.", "I don't think they can be stopped this year.", "The Cavs will give them trouble in the finals.", "I don't think so. They're too good.", "That's what everyone said last year.", "Cavs got lucky last year. Steph Curry was hurt and Draymond Green was suspended.", "Those are just excuses.", "Besides, they added a certain player named Kevin Durant this year...KD", "It's messed up their rhythm", "Did you see the game on Saturday? He had 29 points.", "Yeah, and Steph only had 16 and Klay only had 6.", "Yeah, and they won by double digits! That's my point.", "They aren't playing Lebron and the Cavs though", "I don't care who they play. No team can stop Klay Thompson, Steph, and KD on the same team.", "If anyone can, it's Lebron.", "We'll see.", "We will see. I think the Cavs will do it. Don't ever bet against Lebron", "No one will beat Golden State this year.", "The cavs will"], ["Are you watching the Boston Celtics and Washington Wizards series?", "Is that the series for the finals?", "Yes.  The series is tied 2-2 now.", "That's probably a good series.  Who's been playing the best so far?", "Well, Isiah Thomas has been having some good games", "I like Washington.  Wall is one of my favorite players.", "It's been really physical.  Isiah had his teeth knocked out again.", "I really would like Washington to win, though.  Celtics have been a dynasty long enough!", "That's true, but they're a great franchise.  They deserve to start winning titles again.", "Nah... Cleveland will win it all again.", "Not if the Warriors have their way!", "I tihnk the Warriors are overrated.  They'll cave to the Cavs again.", "Well, at least we don't have to worry about Washington playing them.  They won't make it that far this year.", "Well, neither will the Celtics!", "OK, I'll give you that.  If Durant stays healthy, they may have a chance.", "Nah.... I'm telling you.  Draymond Green will get thrown out of a few games again and it'll be the Cavs all over.", "Well, I can't argue with that or be mad.  LeBron deserves all the titles he wants.", "True.  He's definitely the best player.", "Absolutely.  I wouldn't mind Cleveland winning again.", "Me neither."], ["Did you see the Golden State Warriors game tonight?", "Yes, they won and swept the Jazz.", "They will probably win another championship.", "The only team that has a chance to beat them is Cleveland.", "Cleveland may win a game or two, but that's about it.", "You're probably right.", "Kind of isn't fair that they had a great team and added Kevin Durant.", "Yeah, the NBA is kind of always that way; one or two teams are stacked and everyone else is mediocre.", "Yeah, I wonder how they managed to stay under the cap.", "The cap in the NBA is a soft cap, and essentially a joke.", "The NHL and the NFL have it right with a hard cap.", "Yeah, it creates more balance. Did you know that only about 8 teams have won the championship since 1985.", "That's it? The same old teams always seem to win a championship.", "Yeah, I believe it was only the Lakers, Celtics, Pistons, Spurs, Bulls, Rockets, Cavaliers, Mavericks, Heat, and the Warriors.", "That's 10 teams.", "Still, that's not too much of competitive balance.", "Kind of sucks that it will be one of those teams again: Cavaliers or Warriors.", "You mean the Warriors.", "Yes, the Warriors.

You were there?", "Yes! Up in the nosebleeds, but the atmosphere was awesome.", "That's amazing, especially to be there for a playoff game.", "Yeah. I always thought Steph, Klay, and KD were fun to watch on TV, but it is nothing like seeing it in person.", "I can only imagine. I forgot, how many points did Steph end up with last night? I know he's been in a slump.", "Well he broke out of that slump last night. He finished with 38.", "That's right! And Klay had 42, right?", "Yes, and add in Durant's 34 and you had quite the trifecta.", "Getting Durant in the off-season was such a good move for them.", "I know! I'd take him over Bogut hands down.", "Yeah, I was wishy-washy on him. I miss Barbossa though.", "He could come in at clutch moments, but I'd still take KD.", "Oh, definitely. He really helps pick the team up if Klay and Steph are off.", "He does. But on an \"off\" night you are still getting 28 points, I mean how bad can it be?", "Very true! It looks like we may have a Warriors/Cavs rematch this year for the championship.", "I hope so! That would be one heck of a series.", "Yes! Let's hope the Warriors don't blow it again this year."], ["Any chance you think the Celtics go to the Finals?", "Who says theyre topping Washington?", "Isaiah Thomas will make sure they keep winning.", "Not so much, John Wall is going nuts.", "He comes up small sometimes.", "He might but this team looks better than most.", "Crazy to think the Celtics might have a top 3 pick.", "Oh they definitely will.", "We dont know that for sure.", "We find out in 8 days.", "If they do they may be good for years.", "The NBA is so hit or miss you never know.", "I think they will have success for a while.", "I dont know, free agency kills dynasties.", "Tell that to LeBron James.", "he creates his own", "all conversations come back to him", "you know that. hes the face of the NBA.", "Well he wont win the chip this year.", "Strangers things have happened"], ["Did you see that the Spurs lost to the Rockets?", "I did, but I still think that the Spurs will win the series.", "I saw that the Utah Jazz were eliminated last night?", "They were, but they showed a lot of heart.", "I think that the Lakers will be bad next year.", "Probably, but maybe they will get a good draft pick.", "Russell Westrbrook should win the most valuable player award this year.", "I disagree, I think that James Harden should win.", "Who do you think will win the sixth man of the year award?", "I think that James Johnson will win.", "Do you think that Lonzo Ball will be a good professional basketball player?", "I think he will be average at best.", "Do you think that Chris Bosh will ever play professional basketball again?", "I think that he will retire.", "I think that Kawhi Leonard should win defensive player of the year.", "I think that Draymond Green is more deserving.", "I hope that The Cleveland Cavaliers do not win the championship this year.", "Me too,  I hope that the Spurs do.", "I was sad to see that Tony Parker is injured for the rest of the playoffs.", "Me too, he was playing really well in these playoffs."], ["Did you watch the Cavaliers dismantle the Raptors last night?", "I sure did. Toronto never even had a chance.", "I was surprised it was a sweep, but I knew the Cavs would beat Toronto. The Cavs have the King.", "Everybody knew the Cavs would beat Toronto. Do you think the Celtics can beat the Wizards?", "No. Isiah Thomas doesn't have enough help. When he can't score, neither can the Celtics, and the Wizards are stopping him from scoring.", "Do you expect the Wizards can challenge the Cavaliers?", "No. At best, the Wizards might be able to win one game against the Cavaliers. I think the Cavaliers will have the two best players on the floor.", "You really think Kyrie is better than John Wall?", "Yes, I do. I expect the Cavs to beat the Wizards in four or five games. It would be a minor miracle if it went to six games.", "So then, you think that no one can beat Lebron and the Cavs?", "I didn't say that. No one in the East can beat them though.", "Who are the teams out West that you think can beat them?", "I expect that the Spurs can give them a run for their money. Although I don't think the Spurs will win the West due to Tony Parker's injury. They are always competitive, though.", "Yes. And while there's no defensive player who can stop Lebron, Kawhi Leonard comes closest.", "I agree with that, but he doesn't have enough help. I expect that either the Rockets or the Warriors will come out of the West. The Cavs would beat the Rockets though, I think.", "So, you're saying that the Cavs are going to win this year unless the Warriors do?", "Not quite. If by some miracle, San Antonio comes out of the West, they can beat the Cavs. I don't expect them to win the West, though. The Rockets can't beat the Cavs. The Warriors can.", "Do you really think the Warriors-Cavs series will be different from last year if they meet again?", "Well, first the Warriors were only one made three away from beating the Cavs. Second, the refs allowed Steph Curry to be fouled all through four games straight last year. I hope that doesn't happen again. I think the Warriors were better last year. I think they're better this year. I expect they can win.", "Maybe you are right, but I wouldn't wan to bet against Lebron James."], ["Who do you think will win the NBA title this year? I believe the Cavs will repeat.", "I am inclined to agree, but the Warriors might be tough.", "Yeah, if 2 of the studs from the Warriors get hot, they can take down LeBron.", "I agree with that point. If Durant and Curry get hot, they will win.", "Don't forget Thompson and Draymond....", "I didn't. But can they play enough defense against LeBron?", "LeBron can get all the points he wants. It's the other guys they have to stop.", "So, you say Lebron can score 60 and the Cavs can still lose?", "That's what I'm saying...Just don't let Kyrie or Love have big nights.", "I agree. if they do, then Cavs for sure.", "Are you even watching the playoffs? They are boring this year.", "I don't usually watch until the Finals.", "You think anyone can knock off the Cavs or Warriors before then?", "No chance, unless someone gets hurt.", "I think the Cavs will whip the Celtics in the conference finals.", "If the Celtics even make it. Don't sleep on the Wizards.", "Yeah, if Wall stays hot, they can take Boston.", "But no shot against the Cavs though.", "They could win a game or 2 at most against the Cavs.", "You're absolutely correct. No way the Cavs go down"], ["I just refuse to get on the Seth Curry bandwagon.", "Why is that?  He's putting up numbers like crazy since he's been with the Warriors.", "He just isn't a good all around baskeball player.", "What do you mean?", "He doesn't actually play defense, he just stands there, waiting for one of his teammates to pass him the ball, so he can shoot.", "Yeah, what's wrong with being able to shoot?", "Nothing is wrong with it, and it's a great part of the basketball game, but there are so many other parts he doesn't even try to play!", "Yeah, I can see that.  He is an amazing shooter though.  He's one of the best.", "Hardly, I mean you're forgetting about the greats, man.", "Who are the greats then?
